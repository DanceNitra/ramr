"""RAMR FACT-RETENTION task family. Memory systems increasingly store a COMPILED/summarized 'knowledge object'
instead of (or alongside) raw chunks (compiled knowledge layers, working-memory summaries, fact extraction).
The common assumption: a compiled/summarized object can AUGMENT but should not REPLACE raw data -- because
compilation DROPS facts under a budget. This makes that a measured benchmark metric.

Setup: M independent atomic facts ('The <attr> of the <entity> is <value>.', distinct entity+attr, distinct
values -> uncontaminated, unambiguous). Two contexts, same probe questions (one per fact, asking the value):
  RAW      : all M raw fact sentences (perfect store) -> accuracy ceiling (~1.0)
  COMPILED : the M facts compressed by the model into <= S sentences (a realistic compiled knowledge object)
FACT-RETENTION = compiled accuracy; RETENTION-LOSS = raw - compiled. Sweep M (compression pressure rises with
M/S). FALSIFIER (pre-registered): if compiled accuracy ~= raw at every M (loss < 0.10 even at the highest M),
compilation is lossless and the 'augment-not-replace' claim is FALSE for this model. Cloud-free default (local
qwen); a cloud cross-check can be added via RAMR_MODEL. ASCII prints."""
