inspeximus — a memory layer for AI agents.  (brand: Inspeximus)

The memory that runs an autonomous research OS over ~5,800 notes, distilled to a single file with
no required dependencies. It does the four things agent memory actually needs, the way that held up
in production:

  remember(text)      append-only raw capture, stamped with an ABSOLUTE time (never rewritten)
  recall(query, k)    value-ranked retrieval: relevance × the memory's accrued value, not just
                      cosine similarity — the high-value memories surface first
  consolidate(cap)    the "dream" pass: value-rank under a keep-budget, link near-duplicates, mark
                      stale/superseded — it only ADDS a derived layer, it never edits the raw note
  contradictions()    flag mutually-incompatible memories for REVIEW (never auto-delete)

Design rules that are not optional (each one cost us to learn):
  • Raw capture is immutable. Consolidation adds links/markers; it never overwrites the source —
    that is what stops the slow accuracy drift of LLM-rewritten memory.
  • Absolute timestamps at write time. Relative/derived times rot the moment they're consolidated.
  • Value-ranked, capacity-aware consolidation. The payoff from ranking *what to keep* scales
    super-linearly as the budget shrinks (measured), so retention tracks value, not recency — and
    NOT access-frequency: decaying on reads keeps *popular* memories, but popularity != value, so a
    pure access-reset policy starves the rarely-read-but-load-bearing fact (measured: it retains
    ~3x less total value than a value blend under a tight budget). Forgetting blends value + recency.
  • Report value at the COHORT level (tag / time-block), never per-memory: per-item value at n-of-1
    is statistical noise; cohorts are where the signal lives.
  • Contradictions are flagged for review, not auto-resolved. Silent rewrites destroy trust.

Bring your own embedder for semantic recall (any text->vector fn); with none, inspeximus falls back to a
lexical token overlap so it runs anywhere, today.

#: the eviction docstring already makes for superseded history.
#:
#: MEASURED before this existed (research/probes/audit_code_guard_disarm.py): with 30 recorded deprecations,
#: `capacity=8` plus ten ORDINARY writes left 2, and check_code() then returned [] -- "clean" -- for a snippet
#: resurrecting a deleted symbol. No maintenance call was involved, and `capacity=N` is what docs/API.md
#: recommends under "Run bounded in production", so the guard disarmed itself exactly as a store filled up.
#: consolidate(keep=5) did the same. A guard that fails OPEN under the documented production config is the
#: defect class this codebase keeps finding: a clean verdict about input it structurally stopped examining.
#:

#: asserted in tests rather than imported, so the two modules stay decoupled and cannot drift silently.
#: RESERVED CONTROL-PLANE KEYSPACE for agent-to-agent read grants (see Inspeximus.grant). A grant is an
#: ordinary hash-chained record so it inherits the write receipts, the anchor, provenance() and history()
#: rather than needing a second log -- but it is BOOKKEEPING, not a memory, so it is carved out of the
#: content read path (recall, _tenant_rows) and out of housekeeping (eviction, the consolidate keep-budget).
#: remember() REFUSES this prefix from an ordinary caller: if any writer could mint a key in this namespace,
#: an agent could grant itself access through the normal write path and the ACL would be decorative.

#: meta keys the LIBRARY stamps and then READS to make a decision. `remember(meta=...)` copies the
#: caller's dict onto the record verbatim, and these are read back out of that same dict -- so before
#: 2.4.1 a writer could hand itself any of them.
#:
#: THIS IS THE SECOND TIME THIS HOLE WAS CLOSED. 2.4.0 stopped `mtype="semantic"` from reaching the
#: top trust tier by additionally requiring `meta.graduated_from_episodic`, which the library stamps
#: at the corroboration bar. Measured on the published 2.4.0: `remember(mtype="semantic",
#: meta={"graduated_from_episodic": True})` returns `warrant="earned"` -- the highest tier we report,
#: to a record with no credit, no links and no witnesses. The fix had moved the hole one level down
#: rather than closing it, which is why this is a keyspace and not another single condition.
#:
#: Raised externally by yun520-1 (openclaw/openclaw#7707): "any design where the tier is set by the
#: writer has a forgeable top tier, because the writer is motivated to mark itself highest." He was
#: right in the general form, and further than the specific case he named.
#:
#: NOT an ACL bypass, checked before saying otherwise: a grant is identified by the reserved `key`
#: prefix through `_is_acl_record`, which `remember()` already refuses to mint, so a caller-supplied
#: `meta["acl"]` never becomes a grant. It is reserved here because the library reads it, not because
#: it was exploitable.

#: READ BY THE LIBRARY, WRITTEN BY THE CALLER -- and therefore NOT reserved. The threat is a caller
#: forging something the library believes it stamped itself; a field the library only ever READS is
#: the caller's data by design, and reserving it deletes a feature. `scope` is the case that taught
#: this: it was reserved on the "the library reads it" rule, and 25 grant tests went red because
#: `recall(scope=...)` filters on a scope the CALLER sets. Declared here rather than special-cased in
#: the guard, so the next one is a visible decision instead of a silent exception.

#: The same problem with a different remedy. These four ALSO have named parameters on `remember()`
#: (`user_id`, `agent_id`, `session_id`, `project`), and passing them through `meta` reached the same
#: stamped fields by a second, unmaintained route. Silently dropping them would break a caller who is
#: today getting exactly the behaviour they intended, so they are ROUTED to the named parameter rather
#: than discarded: one path into these fields instead of two, and the explicit parameter wins on
#: conflict.
#:
#: WHAT THIS DOES NOT DO, measured rather than assumed. An earlier version of this note said the route
#: "reaches the SAME validated path it skipped". That was false and a control caught it:
#: `remember(agent_id="*")` stores `*` unchecked, exactly as the meta route did, because
#: `_check_agent_id` guards the GRANT path and `remember()` never calls it. So this converges two
#: routes into one; it does not add validation, and `*` -- reserved in the grant keyspace -- is still
#: an accepted agent id here. Whether it should be is a separate question from the reserved keyspace,
#: and is not silently answered by this release.

    its C encoder and fall back to the pure-Python `_iterencode` path. Measured on a realistic record
    shape, that was the single largest cost in the whole library — a mixed 1,000-write workload spent
    29.8 s of its 29.9 s inside _save, and 25.6 s of that inside json.dumps, because `_save(force=True)`
    runs on every remember() and re-serializes the entire store each time.

    WHY NOT FULLY COMPACT EITHER: `json.dumps(items)` with no indent is ~4.0x faster but emits the whole
    store as ONE line. `indent=1` was chosen deliberately — the store is a user-facing artifact people
    inspect, diff in git, and hand to auditors — so collapsing it to one line trades away something the
    current format exists to provide.

    This layout keeps both. The C encoder runs per record, and the only added whitespace is a newline
    between records, so a store stays line-diffable and greppable while getting most of the speedup.
    Measured, n=20,000 records of ~48 characters, median of 5 (byte counts are exact, not medians):
    indent=1 = 237 ms / 7,704,892 B; this = 80 ms / 6,164,892 B (2.96x faster, 20.0% smaller); fully
    compact = 45 ms / 6,124,891 B. Compact is smaller than this by exactly 40,001 B -- two characters per
    record -- which is the whole price of staying line-diffable. (An earlier revision of this docstring
    put compact at 7.78 MB, LARGER than the one-record-per-line form; that is arithmetically impossible,
    since this layout is the compact encoding plus a separator per record, and the figure was wrong.)
    Round-trip verified identical for all three, and this is formatting only — every digest in the library (state_digest, receipts, the audit
    bundle) hashes PARSED per-record fields, never the file bytes, so no digest changes.

    `allow_nan=False` is preserved per record: a caller-supplied NaN/Infinity would otherwise be written

# --- universal-executor detection (1.2.0) -------------------------------------------------------------------
# WHY: a per-tool reversibility label is unsound for VERB-POLYMORPHIC universal executors -- a shell / eval /
# arbitrary-SQL / generic-HTTP tool whose EFFECT is set by a free-form argument, so the same tool is both
# 'ls' (reversible) and 'rm -rf' (irreversible). MEASURED (inspeximus lab, ToolEmu 330 tools, 2 labelers): tool
# reversibility is ~93% decidable from the signature (Cohen's kappa 0.82) but the ~7% undecidable residual is
# exactly this class, and its realized harm-reach is ENVIRONMENT-conditional -- an isolated executor reaches
# ~0% of external/API irreversible harms but a networked, ambiently-credentialed one reaches ~0.66. So the
# thing that bounds a memory-poisoned agent's irreversible EXTERNAL harm through such a tool is executor
# CONTAINMENT, not a per-tool reversibility flag. This detector + the spend_irreversible(tool=, contained=)
# gate make that undecidability EXPLICIT: an uncontained universal executor is never silently treated as
# reversible. Honest bound: heuristic name/param match (not a proof), and `contained` is a caller ASSERTION
# inspeximus cannot verify -- it forces the declaration, it does not enforce the sandbox.

# "may this still act", and they are different questions with different remedies.
#
# The contract is safal207's (Causal-Memory-Layer#270, discussed on anthropics/claude-code#34556). We

# and the useful thing to be is the second one. The frozen fixture is consumed verbatim by the tests.

#: Fail-closed order. A source-integrity failure must never be masked by a weaker environment verdict:
#: a record whose origin cannot be verified is broken for everyone, while one that is inapplicable here
#: may be fine elsewhere. Different scopes of invalidation, not different severities.

#: never bound it, that absence forces REVALIDATE instead of MATCH. The rule in one line, and it is the
#: sharpest thing in the contract: ABSENCE OF HISTORICAL CONTEXT IS NOT PERMISSION TO ASSUME CONTINUITY.

        memory is about actually change?* Answering it needs a source you can go back to, and on
        2026-08-10 we measured our own deployment: 210,544 records, `source` coverage 98.3%, sources
        resolving to anything re-checkable **0.01%** -- twenty-four records. The field held
        `agent:scholar`, the identity of the WRITER. So reconciliation was not unimplemented here, it
        was impossible, and this method is the half that makes it possible.

        THE FINGERPRINT IS NOT IN `source`. `remember(source=...)` takes a caller's dict verbatim, so a
        digest stored there would be settable by the writer whose drift it is meant to detect -- the
        exact shape of the trust-tier hole closed in 2.4.1. It lives in the reserved meta keyspace,
        which the caller cannot write.

        VERDICTS, per record:
          FRESH        the source resolves and its content still hashes to what we recorded
          DRIFTED      it resolves and the content changed -> re-read it, do not serve it blind
          ORPHANED     it does not resolve any more -> the source is gone
          UNCHECKABLE  no fingerprint: either no source, or one that names a writer rather than a
                       document. This is the honest denominator and the report LEADS with it.

        A REPORT THAT CANNOT FLATTER. `ok` is False whenever nothing was checkable, because "0 drifted"
        over 0 checked is the same sentence as a clean store and must not read like one. This is the
        `verify_attestations` rule applied to the outside world: an empty check is not a passing one.

        `resolver` is an optional callable taking the source doc and returning bytes (or None if it is
        gone), so a caller can point this at a git object store, an S3 bucket or an HTTP fetch. The
        default reads local files only -- deliberately, because guessing how to fetch an arbitrary
        identifier is how a checker starts inventing ORPHANED verdicts.

        THIS EXISTED NOWHERE UNTIL 2.4.0, which was the defect. 2.3.0 started keeping `attested_sig`
        precisely so an auditor would not have to take the write path's word for it -- its own changelog
        says "a non-repudiable identity you cannot re-verify is not one" -- and then shipped no way to
        re-verify it. Across this library the signature was written and never read: the only check
        anywhere was a hand-rolled one inside a test. A field nobody can re-compute is a claim, not an
        attestation.

        What it catches, and each is a real edit an out-of-band writer can make to the JSON:
          * the text changed under a signature (the signature covers the text);
          * the source relabelled (it covers the canonical source, so 'X by S' cannot be replayed as
            'X by T');
          * a record MOVED BETWEEN TENANTS, for writes this store signed itself -- 2.4.0 binds the
            tenant into the message, so relocating a row invalidates it;
          * a signature present with no key, or a key with no signature.

        `expected_key` additionally pins WHO: every attestation must carry that public key. Without it
        this answers "is each signature internally consistent", which a forger holding any key can also
        satisfy -- so a run with no `expected_key` is an integrity check, not an identity one.

        HONEST LIMITS. Externally-attested records (`remember(..., attestation=...)`) are NOT
        tenant-bound: an outside signer cannot sign a binding to a tenant it never saw, so those rows
        verify identically in any tenant and this reports them as valid. Records with no attestation at
        all are skipped and counted, not failed -- most stores have none, and failing them would make
        the check useless where it matters. And a valid signature attests AUTHORSHIP, never truth.

        IT ALSO BINDS NO TIME, and this is a note for whoever adds a backfill rather than a live defect:
        there is no such path today, so every signature here was made at write time. The moment one
        exists -- and "sign my historical records" is a natural thing to want -- a signature made during
        a migration will attest that the store holds this content NOW, not that the content is what it
        was when the record was written, and NOTHING in the record distinguishes the two. The weaker
        guarantee then inherits the stronger one's appearance, silently, which is the shape of every
        defect in this file's history. RFC 3161 is the gap: a timestamp token supplies "this datum
        existed before time T" and a backfilled signature cannot. If you build that path, carry
        `signed_at` separately from the record's own timestamp and have this verifier report the two
        cases differently -- custody-attested is not attested-since-creation. (Raised with a
        collaborator hitting it first, on NousResearch/hermes-agent#34352, 2026-08-11.)

        THIS BINDS PLACEMENT, NOT CARDINALITY, and the distinction is not academic here: the failure
        that motivated tenant binding was tenant-scoped data LOSS (2.3.2 -- a scoped handle's save
        serialised its own filtered view). A row that is GONE carries no failing signature, so this
        answers `ok` on a store that just lost a tenant. Measured: delete every acme row from a signed
        five-record store and this returns ok=True with zero problems, while relocating one row returns
        ok=False -- the same run, so the verifier is demonstrably alive. **`verify_writes()` is the
        check for absence**: with receipts on it names the vanished ids ("written but missing from the
        store (deleted out-of-band)"). Signature for placement, receipt chain for cardinality; neither
        substitutes for the other, and offering this one as protection against loss would be a
        category error.

        Why this exists: 1.82.0 started committing `object`, the value the store SERVES. Records written
        before it carry receipts that never hashed the value, so `verify_writes()` names them and cannot
        check them. The message told operators to "re-write the record" -- and that turned out to be advice
        that does not work: `slash()` appends a receipt only for a GRADUATED memory, so an ordinary record
        had no path at all. Building the path beat rewording the limitation.

        HONEST SCOPE, and it is the whole of it: this binds the record's state AS IT IS NOW. It is not a
        validation of the past and cannot be -- if the value was already edited out of band, this commits
        the edited one and the store will verify clean afterwards. That is why it is an explicit operator
        action with named ids rather than something an upgrade does for you: run it only on records you
        have checked against a copy you trust. Compared with `value_strict=False`, which silences the

        inherited derived_from taint) therefore voids all of them at once, silently, with no inner layer to appeal
        to — attribution is not a fourth axis, it is the floor the others stand on. This binds each write's
        attribution into the tamper-evident receipt chain (see _write_commit) and reports, per memory, whether its
        CURRENT canonical sources still match what was committed at write time. A relabel is thus LOUD, not silent.

        Returns {ok, chain_ok, relabeled, uncommitted, missing}:
          - relabeled: active memory ids whose current sources differ from their receipt (the attack this catches);
          - uncommitted: active ids with no attribution in their receipt (written before this was added, or the
            memory was never receipted) — cannot be checked, so not trusted;
          - missing: ids in the receipt chain no longer in the store.
        TWO honest limits (do NOT read this as tamper-PROOF):
        1. tamper-evidence != CORRECTNESS. A source that was WRONG at write time (an attacker who controls the
           labeling channel, e.g. MINJA) is committed faithfully and this cannot tell it was wrong — the
           genuinely-open oracle problem, untouched.
        2. the chain is only tamper-EVIDENT if it is SIGNED with a receipt_key held OFF the write path (or its head
           is externally anchored). UNSIGNED (the default), an attacker who can silently relabel rec['source'] can
           equally recompute the whole sidecar receipt chain with the new sources and pass this check — so bare
           verify_attribution() only catches a relabel by an actor who can edit the store but NOT the .receipts
           sidecar (e.g. an out-of-band DB edit). For the 'loud' property to hold against a store-capable attacker
           you MUST pass receipt_key=... (Ed25519) with the key out of reach, or anchor the chain head externally.
        Requires receipts enabled at write time. The crypto is textbook (Haber-Stornetta 1991 hash-chains,
        Schneier-Kelsey 1998 tamper-evident logs); the only new bit is committing attribution so a source-keyed
        defense set's single silent failure (relabel) becomes detectable."""

        rec['key']. No similarity threshold, no LLM call — the fix our Crucible replication validated
        (stale-fact recall 41.7% -> 0.0%, where cosine-based detection is near chance at AUROC ~0.61).
        Bi-temporal: only same-key records with valid_from <= rec's are retired; if an active same-key
        record is genuinely newer (later valid_from), the INCOMING rec is the stale one and is retired
        instead — a back-filled value never overwrites the current one. recall() hides superseded records
        by default, so a keyed store never surfaces a stale fact.

        Related, same root: `derived_from` lets a writer inherit ANY record's canonical source. Measured —
        an attacker naming a trusted record as parent becomes attributable to it, and then SPENDS THAT
        SOURCE'S irreversible budget, denying the real owner:

            evil = remember("Revenue is 900M", source=attacker, derived_from=[audited_record])
            _rec_sources(evil) -> {'evilexample', 'bigfourauditor'}
            spend_irreversible([evil], 1.0, budget=1.0) -> allowed ; the auditor is then denied

        Taint inheritance is deliberate (a summary must charge its origins), but nothing checks that the
        writer was entitled to derive from that parent — the same missing writer identity as below.

        SUPERSESSION IS UNAUTHENTICATED, and that is the important limit to state. It branches on tenant,
        valid_from, object and asserts_change — never on WHO wrote. So anyone who can call remember() and
        knows the key string retires the current value:

            remember("Payout wallet is 0xTRUE", key="payout::wallet", object="0xTRUE", source=finance)
            remember("Payout wallet is 0xEVIL", key="payout::wallet", object="0xEVIL", source=attacker)
            -> recall("payout wallet") returns 0xEVIL

        This is the same shape as any last-write-wins store, but note the asymmetry: revert() is
        capability-gated while the write path that achieves the same outcome is not.

        The mitigations are PARTIAL, and the exact shape matters. trust_seeds + recall(trusted_only=True)
        stops the attacker's value being SERVED (it fails CLOSED with no trust root), and attestation= binds
        a claim to a signing source. Neither stops the RETIREMENT: the true record is still superseded, so a
        trusted-only recall returns NOTHING rather than the truth, and the honest value is reachable only
        with include_superseded=True. Measured:

            trust_seeds = {"financeinternal"} ; attacker writes the same key
            recall(trusted_only=True)                         -> []
            recall(trusted_only=True, include_superseded=True) -> ["...0xTRUE"]

        So the guarantee these buy is "you will not be told the attacker's answer", not "you will be told the
        right one". A store taking writes from an untrusted agent needs an authenticated write path, not just
        a trusted read path.

        A far-future `valid_from` is the other side of the same coin: a write dated beyond every honest
        correction wins the bi-temporal comparison permanently, and only finiteness is checked. Bound it
        yourself if callers are untrusted.

        2026-07-16). Ingest an OBSERVATION (evidence, NOT an authoritative write) about `key` that CONTRADICTS the
        current high-confidence settled value. It NEVER writes an authoritative value — it can only REOPEN a
        settled record for steward review (reopened()/resolve_reopened); the record stays 'active' so recall()
        still returns it. Catches the confident wrong-merge write-time can't, and gives the value-obscuring revert
        something to key on. It does NOT decide the reopened case — legit-vs-injected still needs authority.

        TWO keying modes:
        * SUPPORT-KEYED (pass `support`, marintkael's fix 2026-07-16) — this is justification-based truth
          maintenance (Doyle 1979 JTMS: a node's belief is a function of its SUPPORT set, not the proposition, and
          a relabel fires when a NEW justification arrives; de Kleer 1986 ATMS: distinct minimal-environment
          labels = 'distinct novel supports'; Dung 1995 reinstatement: an argument reopens only when a NEW
          attacker/defender enters). Key reopen on NOVELTY-OF-SUPPORT, not on
          value. A restatement whose grounds the ledger has already seen (or that carries no support) is an ECHO
          -> silenced, even though it contradicts the current value; only a contradiction resting on grounds NOT
          in the record's justification set reopens. So replay collapses into the echo case BY CONSTRUCTION (same
          value, same stale support) and the value-disagreement DoS lever falls off, while an honest late
          correction that brings NEW ground still gets through. Corroboration counts DISTINCT novel support
          signatures (splitting one intent into two emissions shares support -> one sig -> does not corroborate),
          which is independence measured at the support level. HONEST LIMIT: novelty-of-support is itself a
          provenance judgement pushed one level down, not certified — reopened() stays a queue, not a resolution.
        * VALUE-KEYED (omit `support`, legacy 1.9.2): reopen on a value-contradiction corroborated by >=
          reopen_corroboration observations. Kept byte-identical for existing callers.

        include_superseded). forget() is for the cases where demotion is not enough: a right-to-be-forgotten
        / erasure request, a poisoned or libellous memory, or a hard correction.

        Select by `ids` (a single id or an iterable) and/or `where` (a predicate fn(record)->bool; e.g.
        lambda r: 'secret' in r['text']). VERIFIED FORGETTING: the matched records are deleted AND their ids
        are scrubbed from every surviving record's `links` and toggle-supersession pointers, and the cached
        vec matrix + token caches are dropped — so a forgotten memory cannot resurface via recall, via a
        consolidation link, or via a stale derived-summary pointer. This is complete because consolidation
        never copies raw text into other records (it only links ids and toggles status) — there is no merged
        blob left holding the forgotten content.

        EVERY deletion emits a hash-chained, content-free tombstone, exactly like forget_subject() and
        forget_pii(). Until 1.24.0 only those two did, which meant a record removed through this method left

        accounting for it, and reported "deleted out-of-band" — the signature of tampering — after a
        perfectly legitimate API call. `request_id` and `basis` are carried into the tombstone's committed
        hash so an auditor can see why a record went, not merely that it did.

        `dry_run=True` PREVIEWS instead of deleting: it returns {would_forget, ids, sample, dry_run:True}
        (a few matched texts so you can eyeball what the selector caught) and touches NOTHING — no delete, no

        without any source. (Until 1.53.0 this line also offered an attested key as `'key:<hex>'`.
        `_rec_sources` has never emitted that prefix, so such a call silently erased nothing.)

        this erases + proves-deletion WITHIN THIS inspeximus store only — NOT the app's vector store, prompt logs,
        or backups; it is an integrity primitive, NOT a compliance certification. The tombstone proves the ACT
        (a record with this surrogate id was erased at T for request R), never the CONTENT, and its signature is
        load-bearing only against a party who does NOT hold receipt_key (the operator who holds the key can forge
        tombstones too — anchor the chain head externally for operator-adversarial audit). Prior art: crypto-
        shredding; Cassandra/event-sourcing tombstones; GDPR Art.30 erasure logs; Crosby-Wallach / Certificate
        Transparency tamper-evident logs.

        `exact=True` proceeds on the collision-safe subset instead of refusing: only records whose RAW
        source string equals `subject` (plus what inherited from them) are erased, and a different source
        that merely canonicalises alike is left untouched. Use it when a DSAR must complete and the guard
        has fired — refusing is right by default, but a guard that cannot be satisfied turns one hostile
        write into a permanent block on a legal obligation.

        `dry_run=True` PREVIEWS the blast radius and touches NOTHING — no delete, no tombstone, no manifest
        cascade, no save. It returns {would_erase, ids, direct, inherited, sample, also_carrying, targets,
        dry_run:True}, and the split is the point: `direct` records name the subject as their own source,
        while `inherited` ones are reached only through derived_from taint. That second number is the one an
        operator cannot predict, and it is not hypothetical — a record repaired by rederive() inherits the
        taint of the source it was rewritten from, so erasing that source takes the repair with it and the
        store is left holding neither the old value nor the corrected one. `also_carrying` lists the OTHER
        subjects whose data would go down with this request, which is where a single erasure quietly becomes
        several. Preview before you commit.

        WHAT THE PREVIEW DOES NOT SHOW. (a) Records that SURVIVE but are modified — `forget()` scrubs the
        deleted ids from survivors' `links` and drops `superseded_by_toggle` pointers into the deleted set, so
        a survivor can silently lose corroboration or its revert target; none of that appears in
        `would_erase`. (b) The app-side cascade: `targets` NAMES the registered erasure targets but the
        preview does not run the manifest against them. (c) Anything outside this store. (d) `sample` returns
        record TEXT, including records ordinary recall would not surface, and the preview writes no receipt —
        treat it as a read of the content, and mind where your call path logs it."""

        This is the structural half of tenant isolation. It used to be a plain attribute holding every
        tenant's records, and 46 methods read it directly — so isolation depended on each of them remembering
        to filter, and an audit found `history`, `provenance`, `as_of`, `why_recalled`, `revert` and the
        aggregate reports had not. Patching them one at a time fixed the instances and left the class: a
        method added tomorrow would read the shared list again, silently.

        Now the scoping lives under the reads instead of beside them. `self.items` cannot see another
        tenant's rows, so a new method is isolated by construction rather than by review. The real list is
        `self._items`; only the handful of call sites that genuinely own it (load, append, forget, shred)
        touch that, and they are the ones a reviewer should look at.

        Cached per (tenant, revision) so the filter is not re-run on every read of a hot path. A BOUND store
        returns an immutable tuple; an unbound one returns the real list. The asymmetry is deliberate: a write
        into a scoped view can only ever be a mistake, and it should raise rather than half-work.

        MIGRATION: records written before tenancy carry no `tenant` field, so a bound handle does not see
        them. Adopting tenancy on an existing store makes prior memories reachable only from the unbound
        store -- stamp them first if you need them scoped.

        AGENT GRANTS ride the SAME chokepoint, for the same reason. When the handle is bound to an agent
        (`store.as_agent("scribe")`), this filter additionally keeps only the records that agent owns or has
        an ACTIVE grant for, so a method added tomorrow is access-controlled by construction rather than by

    # WHY THESE SELECTORS. A grant names a subset of memories by `scope`, `tag`, `key` or explicit `ids` --
    # never by QUERY. Membership in a scope/tag/key/id set is a STORED FACT, decidable in one pass with no
    # embedder, no similarity threshold and no LLM, and it means the same thing tomorrow as today. A
    # query-shaped selector would make the authorised set a function of a similarity score, so the same
    # grant would cover different records after a re-embed, a corpus change, or a different k -- an ACL
    # that silently widens is not an ACL. Deterministic membership is the property worth keeping.
    #
    # HONEST SCOPE. This is logical isolation INSIDE one store and one process, like tenancy: the shared
    # `_items` list is still reachable from a private attribute, so it is the right model when many agents
    # share a runtime, and it is NOT a substitute for separate stores/keys when the agents are mutually
    # hostile and the process itself is the trust boundary. And the WRITE path is unchanged: grants gate
    # READS. Finally, `by` (the granting agent) is an identity the caller asserts, not one this library
    # authenticates -- exactly the limit already stated for supersession. Where an authenticated identity
    # matters, the surface that holds it must supply it.

        `forget_subject()` deletes what is attributable to a subject and tombstones the act. This answers the
        question an operator hits afterwards: did anything survive that still carries the erased material?
        The hard case is never the record itself; it is the summary built from it, which no longer resembles
        the subject's data. (Graphiti documents the same boundary: its `remove_episode` does not regenerate
        node summaries that other episodes still support.)

        **Read `coverage` before `verdict`.** Every structural check here walks DECLARED `derived_from` edges.
        A store whose writers never declared lineage has no edges to walk, so it would report no residue while
        having inspected nothing — a materially different statement from "checked, nothing found". `coverage`
        makes that difference visible instead of collapsing both into one reassuring boolean:
        `{records, with_declared_lineage, undeclared_derived, declared_ratio}`. When nothing is declared the
        verdict is **`unaudited`**, never a pass.

        Returns `{verdict, residue, advisory, coverage, checked, limits}`:
          - `verdict` — `residue_found` | `no_declared_residue` | `unaudited`.
          - `residue` — findings attributable to a DELIBERATE erasure (the vanished record carries a deletion
            tombstone with a request_id or an authority/basis block): `subject_still_attributable`,
            `taint_without_origin` (a derivative outlived the origin it inherited), `dangling_lineage`, and
            `tombstone_gap` (a receipted record gone with no tombstone at all).
          - `advisory` — the same shapes, but where the missing record was removed with NO erasure request.
            Capacity eviction and the consolidation keep-budget both hard-delete for size reasons, and would
            otherwise masquerade as erasure residue in any bounded store. Reported, never counted.
          - `value_possibly_recoverable` — HEURISTIC, only when `values=` is passed; listed in `advisory` and
            never drives the verdict, because matching text proves neither presence (a paraphrase carries the
            fact without the string) nor absence.

        Deterministic, read-only, no LLM. This is evidence about what the store has RECORDED, not proof that
        no copy of the material remains.

        HONEST SCOPE, also returned in `limits`: (1) a derivative whose writer never declared `derived_from`
        carries no taint and is invisible to every structural check here — deliberately the under-tainting
        side of the overtainting/undertainting trade-off argued for dynamic taint analysis by Schwartz, Avgerinos
        & Brumley (IEEE S&P 2010) -- program analysis, not lineage, so we borrow the trade-off, not a result. (2) It covers THIS store only — never your vector index, prompt logs, model weights or
        backups. (3) It reads metadata the writer supplied, so it cannot detect what was never declared, and
        a party that stops declaring lineage will always look clean. Do not treat a pass as discharging an
        erasure obligation.

        A hash chain proves nobody rewrote the past. It says nothing about whether the entries appended

        Kelsey, USENIX Security 1998): after an attacker can write, new entries are attacker-chosen and
        internally valid. Laundering a record costs exactly ONE extra receipt, and nothing in the chain
        marks it as unexpected, because from the chain's point of view it is an ordinary amendment.

        The missing piece is a DENOMINATOR, and only the application has it: you know how many writes,
        amendments (slash/restore) and erasures you performed. This compares that against what the chain
        actually grew by, and itemises the difference.

        The ledger knows what "the old one" is — no value token needed.

        If the store was created with `revert_authority`, this requires `capability` = revert_capability(key)
        (an out-of-band token the content path cannot mint); a missing/wrong one returns
        {"ok": False, "reason": "authorization_required"} and changes nothing. This is the AUTHENTICATION half:
        an unmarked "go back" and a stale echo are byte-identical, so the tie-break cannot come from the text —
        it comes from an authority whose origin an attacker who can only write text cannot author.

        Why an explicit API and not a content write: a value-OBSCURING reversion utterance ("go back
        to the old one", "the earlier value was right") carries NO object to key on, so no content-level
        mechanism can distinguish a legitimate user revert from an attacker-injected one — the two are
        byte-identical text differing only in provenance. inspeximus resolves this by CHANNEL SEPARATION:
        content writes can never undo a supersession (echo_guard retires restatements; an object-less
        utterance never touches the key at all), and reverting is possible ONLY through this explicit
        call, which the harness invokes for an authorized principal. Honest boundary: this moves the
        legitimate-vs-injected decision from the store to the calling agent — a store cannot make it
        (identical content, different provenance), but it CAN guarantee that content alone never flips
        a corrected value, which is the property injected text needs.

        Target selection is deterministic from the supersession ledger: the record whose
        `superseded_by_toggle` points at the current active record (i.e. exactly what the current value
        replaced), never an echo-blocked arrival (those were retired stale-on-arrival, they were never
        the current value). Append-only: history is not edited — the revert writes a NEW record with
        reaffirm=True (the one sanctioned path past the echo guard), so the flip is itself a ledgered,
        attributable event. Returns {"ok": True, "restored": id, "superseded": id, ...} or

          1. REFERENCE RESOLUTION (a text problem): embed the candidate and, using the ledger's own split of
             the key's history into SUPERSEDED (old) and CURRENT records, measure how much closer the
             candidate sits to the old side than the current side. Needs an embedder (`self.embed` or the

             scored as a MARGIN (max sim to old records minus max sim to current records) — the same
             discriminating quantity the decomposition used, not an absolute similarity.
          2. RECENCY ATTRIBUTION (a ledger problem): the old-versus-current split is read straight from
             inspeximus's supersession ledger. No text method is asked to decide which value is current.

        Abstains when the reference does not DISCRIMINATE old from current: |margin| < `margin` (a bare
        "go back" is roughly equally near both, so it names no side) or the best match is below `floor` (an
        off-topic utterance). That is exactly the boundary the analysis measured — where a guess is wrong and
        the authorized-revert channel (submit_revert) is the correct path instead.

        CLASSIFIES ONLY, never restores: a content-path utterance must not flip a corrected value without an
        out-of-band authorization. Returns {intent, target, confidence, current} for an authorized caller to
        act on with submit_revert — consistent with the channel-separation design.

        version reference against the key's timeline, and execute the right ledger operation — so a
        value-obscuring revert ("go back to what we had") works without the caller naming a value, and a
        similarity/cosine path never runs on a revert (a revert is an instruction on the version graph,
        not a value). This ships the split measured in inspeximus/probes/intent_tagger_router_probe.py.

        Resolution (deterministic, no LLM):
          - a revert-marked utterance -> revert. Target: a named historical value if present in the text;
            "original / very first / started with" -> the FIRST version; otherwise the predecessor via
            revert(). Restores go through the sanctioned reaffirm channel, so the flip is ledgered.
          - a value-bearing utterance whose value is new or current -> remember() (keyed supersession).
          - a value-bearing utterance whose value was SUPERSEDED for the key, with no revert marker ->
            the ambiguous echo-or-reaffirm case, and `policy` decides (see below).
        key/object are derived from the extractor hook when not passed; a revert with no resolvable key
        falls back to a plain note (never guesses a ledger key it can't match).

        THE HONEST LIMIT (measured, not asserted): an unmarked restatement of a superseded value is
        AMBIGUOUS BY CONSTRUCTION — a stale echo and a deliberate reaffirm can be byte-identical, so no
        classifier (LLMs measured at ~coin-flip: 0.35-0.55) can separate them from text. `policy` picks
        the failure mode you accept:
          - "safe" (default): treat as an echo — never restores. With echo_guard on it lands retired
            (judge-logged 'echo_guard'); with echo_guard off it is written WITHOUT the key so it cannot
            LWW-clobber the current value. Cost: a legitimate unmarked reaffirm is refused (measured
            1.00 echo-blocked / 0.00 reaffirm-honored — reproduce with
            `python probes/echo_policy_panel.py`, which needs no dataset, no network and no LLM).
          - "context": restore when `context` (the preceding turn) shows change-awareness (a change word
            + the current value). Separates honest twins (1.00/1.00) but is FORGEABLE — an attacker who
            writes two turns walks through it (forged-context echo restored 100%). Use only when the
            context channel is trusted.
          - "trusting": treat as a reaffirm — always restores (0.00 echo-blocked / 1.00 honored).
        The unforgeable separator is provenance — an authorized revert() call or an explicit marker —
        never smarter classification; that is the channel-separation thesis, now with the receipt.

        just the latest value. No graph DB: keyed supersession already stamps every record with a
        validity interval [valid_from, invalidated_at) (invalidated_at=None means still current), so
        the answer is the record whose interval contains `when`.

        Why it matters: a plain memory store only tells you the value NOW; audit, debugging, and
        'what did the agent believe when it made decision X' need the value as of that moment. A
        back-filled record (added later with an earlier valid_from) is placed by its event-time, so

        None if nothing was known for `key` yet at that time. Ties (overlapping intervals from an
        unclean history) resolve to the latest valid_from <= when.

        commitment that makes a later relabel loud. But they live in history() / grade() /
        verify_attribution() / anchor(). This assembles them for ONE fact, in the order an auditor asks.

        Pass `key=` (the supersession key — provenance of a FACT, across every value it has held) or `id=`

            verified key; the ancestors a retraction would reach; the orphan flag; and the acting
            user/agent/session when the caller supplied them.
          - trust: the evidence grade (claimed | corroborated | verified | settled), earned from external
            ratifications and corroboration — never settable by the writer.
          - timeline: history(key) — every value held, its validity interval, and WHICH policy retired it.
          - integrity: whether THIS record is covered by a write receipt; whether its content and its
            attribution still match what was committed at write time (relabel detection); whether the
            receipt chain verifies and is signed; plus the current anchor, so the answer can be pinned.

        TWO KINDS OF DECISION, and only one of them has a "current" value. A decision recorded with
        `remember_decision(topic=...)` is a VALUE on a topic: it is keyed `decision::<topic>` and a
        later one on the same topic retires it, so asking "what is in force" is meaningful and the
        answer is one record. A commit message is an EVENT: keyed `commit::<sha>`, unique forever,
        and it does not retract its predecessor. Both are decisions and both belong in the store, but
        enumerating the second kind returns the whole project history -- on any real repository that
        is thousands of records, and it would bury the handful that are actually in force.

        So `key_prefix` defaults to the value namespace. Pass `key_prefix=""` to enumerate the current
        record for every key regardless of kind, or `"commit::"` for the commit log alone.

        Why this exists as a separate call. `recall()` finds a decision by similarity, and similarity is
        the wrong instrument for this question. Measured on the cross-session dogfood corpus (2,571
        records): the query "how does a release get published these days?" shares ZERO tokens with the
        decision it is asking for ("publish releases from the trusted publisher workflow"), so the
        current decision ranks 25th with the read-purity default and 29th with the library default,
        below a draft note that merely repeats the query's surface words. The decision was in the store
        the whole time and reachable; ranking put it out of reach of any sane k.

        But "which decision is in force on topic X" does not need ranking at all. The store already
        knows: keyed supersession leaves exactly one active record per key, so the answer is a scan,
        not a search. This returns it -- deterministic, O(n), no embedder, no model, and no dependence
        on whether a session digest happened to capture the decision when it was made.

        Ordering is newest-first with the id as the tie-break, so two calls on the same bytes return the
        same list in the same order. `tag` filters to decision-shaped records; pass tag=None to
        enumerate the current record for every key. Retired records are never returned, which is the
        half of the correction case that already worked -- this call fixes the other half.

        active memories) and a LEXICAL+SEMANTIC HYBRID (Reciprocal Rank Fusion) once it grows past that —
        the hybrid robustly beat either channel alone in our agent-memory benchmark (details in the recall
        body / inspeximus/probes/locomo_retrieval_map.py). Force a single channel with mode='lexical' /
        'semantic', or the fusion explicitly with mode='hybrid'. Semantic/hybrid need an embedder (set on
        the store); without one, or if embedding fails, recall falls back to lexical automatically.

        where: an OPT-IN metadata pre-filter applied to the candidate pool BEFORE ranking — the cheap
        'filter before you rank' lever (measured on LoCoMo: a metadata pre-filter can beat retriever choice;
        inspeximus/probes/locomo_metadata_prefilter.py). A dict of field -> condition; a record must match ALL
        fields (AND). Each field is matched against the record's top-level attributes first, then its meta
        dict, so both `valid_from`/`mtype`/`key` and any `meta` key work. A condition is either a scalar
        (equality), a list/tuple/set (membership), or a dict of operators:
        {"$gte","$lte","$gt","$lt","$in","$nin","$ne","$contains"} — e.g. a time range
        where={"valid_from": {"$gte": t0, "$lte": t1}} (hard-filter the SOLVED half), or a closed-set
        entity where={"speaker": {"$in": ["Caroline","Mel"]}}. NOTE: this is a HARD filter — a record that
        doesn't match is removed, so on lossy/predicted extraction prefer a broad/loose filter (or rerank)
        over an aggressive one, since a wrong filter hard-deletes the answer (measured harm mode).

        this project/workspace, PLUS every memory that carries no project stamp. Records stamped for a

        unstamped-is-global rule is deliberate: a store written before you adopted project scoping has no
        stamps, so adopting one narrows what you see WITHOUT hiding anything you already had. Pass
        project=None to search across every project (the "I know I wrote this somewhere" query).

        memories — those that meet the same bar inspeximus uses for episodic->semantic GRADUATION (an EARNED
        net-positive outcome via credit() [good>0 and good>=bad], OR already-graduated 'semantic' type, OR
        >=2 DISTINCT-canonical-source corroborating links). This is the retrieve-then-INFLUENCE split: recall

        0% on all three tested retrievers (MiniLM/BGE/Contriever) and all scales, because an injected poison
        never earns corroboration while legitimate memories earn it through use. It GENERALIZES precisely
        because it lives in provenance metadata, not embedding geometry. HONEST COST (calibration tradeoff):
        a rare-but-true memory that has not yet earned corroboration is filtered too (measured recall 1.00
        corroborated vs 0.08 uncorroborated) — so this is for adversarial / untrusted-ingestion use, where a
        recalled-but-uncorroborated memory should inform but not unilaterally drive an action. It RAISES
        attacker cost (a single free injection is filtered; defeating it needs >=3 coordinated records with
        >=2 independent forged provenances) rather than making poisoning impossible. Reversible: default
        False = legacy recall. Call `influence_gate_report()` first to see this gate's LIVE cost on your store
        (it is density-dependent: ~51% of legit recalls filtered when memories are used ~once, ~6% when dense
        — inspeximus/probes/oracle_separation_density.py) and the load-bearing caveat that it rides on an
        un-self-gradable credit() oracle.

        prefer / prefer_trust (OPT-IN, default None -> zero behavior change): a SOFT, trust-weighted metadata
        filter. Unlike `where` (a HARD filter that DELETES non-matching records — so a wrong filter hard-
        deletes the answer), `prefer` takes the same condition dict but only BOOSTS matching records'
        score by (1 + prefer_trust * gain), leaving non-matching records rankable. prefer_trust in [0,1] is
        HOW MUCH to trust the filter cue this call: pass a low value when your metadata extractor is unsure
        (weak/ambiguous match) so the filter gracefully backs off toward plain recall; prefer_trust=0 == no
        filter. This is the a-priori-trust lever: weight the filter by the RELIABILITY of the extraction
        (e.g. alias-match strength: exact-name hit -> ~1.0, no-name/ambiguous guess -> ~0.0), NOT by the
        extractor model's own self-reported confidence (which is corrupted in the overconfident-on-wrong
        case). MEASURED (inspeximus/probes/locomo_soft_prefer_filter.py) on LoCoMo: soft prefer weighted by
        alias-strength gives the filter's benefit on reliable (exact-name) queries while backing off on
        ambiguous ones where extraction fails -- beating both no filter and a hard `where` filter under
        imperfect extraction. Reversible: prefer=None = legacy recall.

        MULTI-DIMENSION prefer (compose several soft cues at once): pass `prefer` as a LIST of specs, each
        either {"cond": <dict>, "trust": <0..1>} or a (cond, trust) tuple. Matching dimensions compose as a
        PRODUCT of neutral-at-1.0 factors — pref = Π (1 + trust_i * gain) over the dims a record matches — so
        a record matching two cues is boosted more than one matching a single cue, and non-matching dims are
        inert (factor 1.0). A single dict + scalar prefer_trust is the one-dimension case (unchanged). Cap the
        TOTAL boost with `prefer_max_boost` (a ceiling on the product, like Elasticsearch function_score's
        max_boost); default None = uncapped. MEASURED (inspeximus/probes/locomo_composed_soft_filters.py) on LoCoMo:
        on questions carrying two independent cues (a resolved time window AND a named speaker), the product
        composition reached recall@20 0.865 vs 0.755 for the best single cue (+0.110, bootstrap CI excludes 0);
        a naive summed boost CAPPED at one dimension's trust crowded out (-0.053, the cap flattened the joint
        evidence — the classic 'combine outside the saturating form' failure, BM25F, Robertson et al. CIKM
        2004). So: compose as a PRODUCT, and if you cap, cap the product, not the summed trusts. This mirrors
        production search (Elasticsearch function_score defaults score_mode=multiply). Reversible: a single
        dict / None behaves exactly as before.

        tie_recent (OPT-IN, default None -> zero behavior change): NEAR-TIE RECENCY REORDER for stale-vs-
        fresh fact competition. When a fact is later corrected in free text, SRO supersession never triggers
        and the STALE value can outrank the fresh one (measured on MemBench knowledge_update: the stale
        value wins rank-1 in 32.7% of update questions, identically for raw cosine and inspeximus semantic —
        inspeximus/probes/membench_recall_probe_v2.py). Pass a small similarity epsilon (measured sweet spot
        0.02-0.05 on centered cosine): candidates whose RELEVANCE is within tie_recent of the strongest
        candidate's relevance are re-ordered newest-first (by valid_from, falling back to ts) ahead of the
        rest; everything below the band keeps its score order. MEASURED
        (inspeximus/probes/membench_recency_tiebreak_probe.py, 222 questions incl. 3 control splits):
        tie_recent=0.05 cuts stale-beats-fresh 0.327 -> 0.109 (3x) at ~zero hit@1/5 cost on non-update
        control splits; a LINEAR position bonus was measured USELESS (no SBF movement before it damages
        controls) — the band reorder is the shape that works. HONEST SCOPE: (a) in the benchmark the
        correction always comes after the original mention (by construction); the control-split cost is
        the fairness check; (b) adversarial hole: an ECHO of the stale value re-stated AFTER the correction
        would be promoted — tie_recent trusts recency inside the band, so do not use it on hostile
        ingestion without provenance gating (combine with influence_only). Reversible: None = legacy."""

        # record-id STRINGS, whose iteration order depends on per-process hash randomisation. Two identical
        # stores answering the same query therefore returned different top-k ORDER between processes:
        # measured, three records tied at score 0.564 and swapped places in 4 of 20 runs, and under
        # PYTHONHASHSEED=0 vs 1 the order differs outright. For a library whose stated property is
        # determinism, and for any consumer that takes the top-1 of a tie, that is a wrong answer rather
        # than a cosmetic one. `ts` then `id` is stable across processes and meaningful: older first.
        # The tie-break is INSERTION POSITION, resolved against the store's own list. First attempt used
        # (ts, id) and made it worse -- records written in the same clock tick share `ts`, so the tie fell
        # through to `id`, which is random per instance: 4/20 runs agreed instead of 16/20. Position is the
        # only key here that is both stable across processes and meaningful (older first).
        # Keyed on the record ID, not on object identity: `items` hands out copies, so `id(obj)` never
        # matched and the tie-break silently did nothing (18/20 instead of 20/20, which looked like an
        # improvement rather than a lookup that always missed). Building a dict for LOOKUP is fine -- it
        # was ITERATING a set of random id strings that made the order vary in the first place.
        # The sort key must be TOTAL, or ties fall back to arrival order -- and candidates arrive through
        # sets of record-id strings, whose iteration depends on per-process hash randomisation and on ids
        # that are random per store. Measured before this: two identical stores, identical scores,
        # different top-k order in 6 of 60 runs, on BOTH the default and the reinforce=False path (it was
        # never about reinforcement; an earlier reading of one sample said it was, and was wrong).
        # Position first, because older-first is the meaningful order. `text` last so the key stays total
        # even when the position lookup misses -- a tie-break that silently degrades to arrival order is
        # how this survived a position-based fix that measured 18/20 and looked like progress.
        # The score is QUANTISED for ranking (see _RANK_QUANTUM). The lexical channel accumulates over an
        # unordered collection, so two records equal in every way that matters differ in the last bits of
        # a float, and a raw comparison treats that summation noise as a real difference. Measured on a
        # store where three records score 0.564: mode="lexical" reordered on 40 of 40 runs, "semantic" 2,
        # "hybrid" 4, and "auto" inherits whichever it routes to.
        #
        # Ties then keep INSERTION order, because Python's sort is stable and candidates are gathered in
        # store order. That is asserted in tests/test_recall_is_deterministic.py rather than re-imposed
        # here: an explicit (position, text) tie-break was written first and NO mutation could tell it
        # apart from its absence -- eight-way ties came back in insertion order with it removed, on four
        # hash seeds. A guard nothing can distinguish from nothing is a check that cannot fail, and this
        # repository has spent the week deleting those. The property is real and now tested; the code that
        # merely restated it is gone.
        # REVERTED to the raw score, deliberately, after the quantised version broke retrieval.
        #
        # The determinism defect is real: the lexical channel accumulates over an unordered collection, so
        # the same record scores differently between runs (measured spread 5.7e-10), and three nominally
        # tied records rotated in 7% of runs. Quantising to 6 places removed that completely -- one order
        # over 120 runs in every mode, identical across six hash seeds.
        #
        # And it cost more than it bought. In the ADK crowded-store scenario (60 other users' memories
        # plus the one you asked for) the target ranks FIRST on the raw score while being EXACTLY equal to
        # 58 of them and 5.7e-10 above the other two. Quantising merged that margin away, the target fell
        # to the tie, and the memory the caller asked for stopped being found at all. "Deterministic but
        # cannot find your memory in a crowded store" is a worse property than "finds it, with a 7% tie
        # rotation", so the trade is refused until there is a fix that does not have to choose.
        #
        # What the measurement actually says: the run-to-run noise (5.7e-10) and the smallest MEANINGFUL
        # gap in this corpus (5.7e-10) are the same size. No quantum can separate them. The fix has to
        # remove the noise at its source -- a deterministic accumulation order in the lexical scorer --
        # not paper over it at the sort.
        # Equal relevance -> the MORE RECENT memory first, declared rather than emergent.
        #
        # This was always the behaviour; it just arrived by accident. Sub-second differences in the decay
        # factor gave a newly-written record a microscopic edge, and that edge was what surfaced the
        # memory you asked for in a crowded store: measured, the target ranked FIRST while being exactly
        # tied with 58 competitors on relevance. Quantising the decay age to whole seconds -- necessary,
        # because sub-second resolution on an hours-long half-life is pure noise -- removed the accident
        # and the target fell out of the window with it. The ADK audit caught that before release.
        #
        # So recency becomes an explicit tie-break. It is the same policy the store already holds
        # everywhere else: when two memories are equally relevant, the newer one is the better answer.
        # ...and INSERTION POSITION last, because `ts` is not fine enough to be a total order: the clock
        # granularity is ~15 ms here and eight records written in a loop share a timestamp, which put the
        # tie straight back on arrival order (3 distinct orders over 120 runs). An earlier version of this
        # key was deleted as unfalsifiable when the only fixture was small enough that arrival order and
        # insertion order coincided -- that judgement was made on too weak a test, and this is where it
        # earns its place.
        # Recency is expressed as INSERTION POSITION, not as `ts`. Same policy, no clock: a wall-clock
        # timestamp has ~15 ms granularity here, so records written in a loop sometimes share a tick and
        # sometimes do not, and sorting on it put the order back at the mercy of machine jitter (3 distinct

        counts; never edits raw text. `outcome` may be a bool, a sign (>0 good), or a verdict string
        (good/right/correct/reproduced/hit vs bad/wrong/failed/miss).

        `warrant` (OPT-IN, matters only when the store flag credit_requires_warrant is on): a token/string

        credit whose warrant is exogenous to the record (not None, and not the record's own source/lineage)
        also increments `good_warranted`; the influence gate then counts only warranted good. This
        structurally breaks the MINJA self-graded-outcome loop (an agent crediting its own recalled poison as
        a success): with no exogenous outcome to name, the self-grade raises good but never good_warranted, so

        the same way a source string is (an attacker who can forge an outcome token can still warrant) — it
        raises attacker cost and is meant to be paired with verifiable provenance, not a proof of truth.
        NO EVIDENCE TRAIL, and this is the limit to know. A credit changes `good`/`bad`, which the influence
        gate and corroboration check read — so it decides whether a record can be served under
        recall(influence_only=True). But it emits NO write receipt, and `state_digest()` does not cover
        standing, so after `credit([poison], outcome=True, weight=1e6)`:

            receipts    1 -> 1        (unchanged)
            state_digest              (unchanged)
            verify_writes() -> True   (clean)

        Measured. The promotion is invisible to every integrity surface this library sells. The self-grading
        risk is already disclaimed via credit_requires_warrant (a warrant STRING is spoofable); what was not
        said is that the promotion leaves no trace to audit afterwards. If outcomes come from anywhere an
        attacker influences, gate them at the source — there is no after-the-fact check here.

        WHY this and not credit(bad): credit() is append-only, so a net-positive sleeper survives one bad

        deterrence bond scales with 1/P(detected), so the penalty blows up on the slow salami attack), so the
        signal has to be cumulative. On each attributed outcome, a one-sided CUSUM: S = max(0, S + weight*(bad -
        k)); alarm at S >= h. Attribution rides the derived_from taint (a bad outcome on a summary charges ALL
        its inherited sources), so slices later summarized still accumulate against their origin — the per-source
        budget and the slash are the same plumbing on the provenance substrate.
        Drop-in for credit() (also records the per-memory good/bad standing): monitor(recalled_ids, outcome).

        THREE honest limits (from a full adversarial review — do not overclaim this 'solves' poisoning):
        1. NOT exact-optimal: (x - k) is the Gaussian-mean-shift CUSUM; the exactly-optimal statistic for a
           Bernoulli bad-indicator increments by the log-likelihood ratio. This is a CUSUM-TYPE detector.
        2. k IS A TOLERATED-RATE PRICE, NOT A WALL: an attacker who holds its per-source bad-rate at/below k
           produces non-positive drift -> S -> 0 -> PROVABLY undetectable (the ARL<->detectability duality). So
           this catches the careless/impatient poisoner; a patient one nets a bounded k x exposure residual —
           the detection-latency floor moved to k, not closed. Lowering k to chase it just raises false alarms
           on honest sources.
        3. DO NOT AUTO-FIRE THE IRREVERSIBLE PENALTY. auto_slash DEFAULTS OFF for a reason: 70 years of
           auto-penalty systems (SPC -> fraud -> content moderation) converged on automatic DETECTION + a
           human-reviewable, REVERSIBLE penalty, never auto-fired forfeiture — because a drifting base-rate
           guarantees false alarms, and with taint a single false positive nukes a whole downstream tree
           (guilt-by-linkage), and if outcomes are attacker-influenceable (MINJA) the trigger becomes a framing
           weapon (feed bad outcomes attributed to a rival -> auto-slash the rival; cf. RepTrap / bad-mouthing).
           Recommended: on alarm, cap/freeze the source's forward influence (reversible) and queue a HUMAN
           review; confirm the slash by hand; keep restore() one call away.

        Tuning: `k` in (0,1) is the bad-rate you contractually tolerate (drift reference); `h` sets the
        false-alarm rate (ARL ~ exp(h)) and the detection delay ~ h/(true_rate - k) — the Lorden floor.
        `auto_slash=True` is an explicit opt-in for a high-integrity, un-self-gradable oracle only. State
        persists to a side file (cross-session). Returns {alarms, slashed, cusum}. Undo a false alarm with

        the rate-detector (monitor) provably CANNOT: the strictly-below-k patient attacker. monitor()'s k is a
        tolerated RATE, so an attacker holding bad-rate BELOW k gives the CUSUM negative drift -> no detection
        power above the baseline false-alarm rate, netting k x exposure — and exposure is PER-WINDOW, so over an
        unbounded horizon its TOTAL irreversible blast grows without bound. Capping a rate never bounds the
        integral. This caps the integral directly: each irreversible (hard-to-undo) action an application is about
        to take is metered against the LIFETIME budget of every source that influenced it (own source OR inherited
        derived_from taint). Once a source has spent its budget, further irreversible actions carrying its influence
        are DENIED — so THAT source's total irreversible damage is bounded by the budget, a finite number YOU
        choose, not a rate you tolerate forever. This bounds a KNOWN source only: a Sybil/whitewashing attacker
        gets a fresh budget per identity, so the identity count (bounded by a DIFFERENT axis — a capability ceiling
        or identity cost; Douceur, Friedman-Resnick) is what caps the total, not this — the budget relocates the
        residual to the identity axis, it does not close it.

        Call it as the gate on the IRREVERSIBLE TAIL ONLY: spend_irreversible(recalled_ids, amount=blast) returns
        {'allowed': bool}; iff allowed, the caller performs the irreversible action and the spend is booked
        (monotonic). REVERSIBLE influence is never metered — genuinely-good sources keep UNBOUNDED reversible
        influence and only their irreversible tail is finite (the everyone-pays shape of a hard capability ceiling,
        but charged only where the action is actually irreversible). The tightest contributing source binds: an
        action tainted by an exhausted source is blocked, exactly as slash() burns every derived summary a caught
        source fed.

        Orthogonal to standing: NOT refunded by restore() (an irreversible action cannot be un-done, so its
        integral is permanent) and does NOT read good/bad. It composes with the other axes as price(k, monitor) +
        BOUND(this lifetime budget) + a reversible human gate(slash/restore) on the irreversible tail — but this is
        NOT a closed decomposition: all three lean on a fourth, unbounded axis, SOUND ATTRIBUTION — the budget, the
        rate detector, and the gate all assume the app can correctly assign an action to its source and correctly
        label its irreversibility + blast `amount`; a misattributed or mislabeled action (or an attacker-influenced
        classifier) escapes all of them. Two more honest limits: refund-free forfeiture is itself a griefing vector
        (get bad irreversible actions attributed/taint-linked to a rival's source and you permanently exhaust its
        budget — RepTrap on the budget axis), and `amount` is caller-supplied so one action of size=budget exhausts
        a source in a single shot (k never enters the guarantee; the bound is the budget, per source). Prior art
        (textbook; the shipped plumbing is what's new): a total-budget-on-cumulative-cost is the differential-
        privacy privacy budget (a total epsilon caps cumulative leakage across queries under composition; Dwork &
        Roth 2014), an SRE error budget, a VaR / loss limit, and Sagas' compensable-vs-non-compensable split
        (Garcia-Molina & Salem 1987) — 'cap the integral, not the rate'. Persists to a side file (cross-session).
        Returns {allowed, exhausted, sources, spent}. Deliberately no cheap programmatic refund — raise a reviewed
        source's ceiling by calling with a higher budget or editing the side file by hand."""

        different FIXTURES reported under one claim, not a disagreement, and the operating point is the whole
        difference. Both are multi-hop FULL-EVIDENCE recall@50 on LoCoMo with a model reader in the loop
        (reader sees the question + round-1 hits only, never the gold), equal retrieval budget B=50:

            n=276, ALL 10 conversations (the full benchmark):  flat 0.145 -> iterative 0.297   = 2.05x
            n=70,  the 3 HARDEST conversations (a subset):     flat 0.057 -> iterative 0.186   = 3.3x

        The 3.3x is the harder subset and the flattering ratio; the full-benchmark 2.05x is the citable one,

        (active memories whose nearest active neighbour is >= dup_threshold, no value clash — sampled at 400 for
        cost). Read-only; the surface that proves a store did NOT accumulate 800 copies of one fact.

        COST, because "sampled at 400 for cost" says a bound was applied without saying what it costs, and
        this is an MCP tool an agent can call mid-conversation. The sample caps the number of QUERIES, not
        the work each one does: every one of the 400 is a full `recall`, which scores every active record.
        So the redundancy estimate is O(400 x n), and n is the whole store.

        MEASURED on this machine, no embedder (the lexical path), records of the shape
        "record N alpha beta gamma deploy salary" over 7 sources, median of 5 with the observed range:

            n=2,000    ~2 s    (1.81-2.34, spread 25%)
            n=8,000   ~12 s   (10.63-12.41, spread 15%)

        Two significant figures, deliberately: the run-to-run spread here is 15-25%, so a three-digit
        number would be a precision this measurement cannot support. Treat these as the order of
        magnitude on one machine, not a benchmark. The call COUNT is the part that does not vary --
        profiled at n=4,000, essentially the whole run is inside those 400 recalls (1.6M _lexsim calls),
        and tests/test_memory_report_cost_is_as_documented.py pins the count rather than the seconds.
        The other four figures (active, superseded, by_type, linked, decayed) are single passes and
        effectively free; if you want a cheap store summary, they are what you are paying for.

        This is a documented cost, not a defect to route around: the sampling is deliberate and seeded, and
        making the nearest-neighbour search sublinear needs an inverted index, which is an architectural

    # ── SESSION BOUNDARY + CROSS-SESSION DIGEST (deterministic, zero-LLM) ─────────────────────────────
    # An agent finishes a session; when the next one starts it should already know what happened. The
    # usual implementation sends the transcript to an LLM to summarise it. This does not: the digest is a
    # LEDGER DIFF over the store's own supersession ledger — which keys changed value, which decisions
    # were recorded, what was erased, what is still open — so it is instant, free, byte-reproducible, and
    # auditable line by line. There is no summariser here to hallucinate, drift, or cost anything.
    #
    # Three primitives, in the order a host calls them:
    #   open_session()    -> mark the boundary (keyed, so exactly one session is open at a time)
    #   close_session()   -> write ONE digest record for the window (the ledger diff)
    #   session_context() -> the size-bounded block to inject at the START of the next session
    #
    # WHY ONE KEY FOR EVERY DIGEST. All digests share `SESSION_DIGEST_KEY`, so a new one RETIRES the
    # previous one through ordinary keyed supersession. That buys three things for free: `recall("what
    # changed last session", k=1)` is unambiguous (exactly one digest is ever active), `history(key)` is
    # the full session timeline, and `revert(key)` steps back one session. A per-session key would put N
    # near-identical digests in the pool and make the k=1 answer a coin flip between them.

        Two deterministic signals, both cheap (O(neighbourhood), not the O(n^2) `contradictions()` scan):
          - keyed_value_change: an active memory shares `key` but carries a DIFFERENT `object` (or, if no
            object is given, its text clashes) — a value update on a managed key, the thing to gate on for
            a high-stakes fact.
          - clash: among memories SIMILAR to `text` (>= sim_threshold), a value clash (numeric update) or a
            negation/polarity flip. Crucially this is NOT triggered by a pure duplicate — a restated
            identical fact has no value/negation clash — so it separates a contradiction from a near-dup,

    but forwards EVERY other attribute to the parent store, so all data + config are shared by reference (one
    items list, one file, one cache) while the tenant-sensitive operations run bound to THIS view's tenant.

    Implementation: the handful of tenant-aware Inspeximus methods are re-bound onto the view (so `self.tenant` inside
    them is the VIEW's tenant), and their tenant-aware internal helpers (_supersede_by_key, _tenant_rows) are
    re-bound too; everything else (`items`, `_save`, `_qvec`, `embed`, config flags, ...) resolves to the parent
    via __getattr__, so reads/writes land on the shared store. Non-tenant methods (credit, verify_*, anchor, ...)
    are used as-is on the parent through __getattr__ and are unaffected by tenancy.

    SINCE 1.90.0 the same view carries a second, independent scoping dimension: `agent` (see
    Inspeximus.as_agent), the agent-to-agent read ACL. It is the same class deliberately -- the two
    dimensions compose (tenant first, then the grant allow-list), and a second view class would have meant

# Ready-made write-path extractors (set `m.extractor = ...`). The extractor derives a (key, object) from free
# text so supersession/echo_guard/revert engage WITHOUT the caller passing an explicit key. inspeximus ships two:
#   - regex_extractor : DETERMINISTIC, no LLM, no dependency — keeps the zero-LLM-on-write moat. Conservative
#     by design (returns None unless a clear subject/relation pattern matches), because a mis-derived key
#     mis-supersedes; a returned None just falls back to a plain append.
#   - make_llm_extractor(call_fn) : OPT-IN factory. Wraps YOUR llm(prompt)->str call to extract (key, object).
#     This PUTS AN LLM ON THE WRITE PATH — you trade determinism/zero-cost for auto-capture of unstructured text.
# Both are fail-open (Inspeximus.remember swallows extractor exceptions and appends the raw text).

# CONVERSATIONAL SURFACE FORMS (1.90.0). The shipped patterns keyed a clean declarative sentence and
# nothing else, which is what README's "honest scope" paragraph admits. Measured on a 15-chain
# conversational fixture (benchmarks/chain_binding/) BEFORE any change: 2 of 15 correction chains bound,
# and the store therefore degenerated to keep-everything on exactly the input the product is sold for.
# Four surface facts caused it, none of them about meaning:
#   1. every pattern was anchored at ^ against the WHOLE string, so any leading clause killed the match
#      ("Dana left, so my manager is Priya now" -> no key at all; the subject class has no comma).
#   2. the OBJECT side already got a leading-adverb strip and the SUBJECT side got none, so "actually my
#      title" / "so my current title" / "my title" are three keys that can never meet.
#   3. first person was not canonical: "my title is X" keyed on 'my title' while "I work at Y" keyed on
#      nothing, so no first-person chain could survive a change of phrasing.
#   4. the non-referring guard read `i` but not `i'm`, so "I'm now in the PST timezone" and "I'm now the
#      on-call engineer" BOTH keyed on "i'm" and retired each other -- a live data-loss path, not a miss.
# Everything below is closed-list surface normalisation: no lexicon of world knowledge, no model, no
# dependency. Where a chain needs world knowledge to bind ("I'm a Principal Engineer now" is a *title*),
# it deliberately still returns None -- see regex_extractor's docstring for that boundary.

# A subject: no comma, so a clause can never be swallowed. The lower bound is ONE character, not two --
# at two, the single most common conversational subject in English, "I", could not match any pattern, and
# the bare-copula fallback then consumed the verb instead and produced the key "i am".

def regex_extractor(text):
    """text -> (key, object) | None. DETERMINISTIC: no LLM, no dependency, no network — this is the
    zero-LLM-on-write path, and it stays that way.

    Recognises, in this order: "X's Y is Z", "the Y of/for X is Z", "X is/moved to the Z Y" (the relation
    is the head noun of the complement), "my Y is Z", "<agent> changed <NP> to Z", "X lives in / works at
    Z", and the bare copula "X is Z". Conversational packaging is normalised first — leading discourse
    markers ("actually", "correction:", "so"), trailing time adverbials ("... now", "... last week"),
    `I'm`/`you're` contractions, current-marking modifiers ("my CURRENT title" == "my title"), and a
    leading clause ("Dana left, so my manager is Priya now") — so a chain of corrections lands on ONE key.

    First person is canonical: `I`, `me`, `my X` all resolve to the single referent `self`, and a possessed
    third party nests ("my wife" -> `self.wife`) instead of becoming a relation on the user.

    WHERE IT STOPS, on purpose. A key is only derived when the sentence NAMES the relation. When the later
    turn names only the VALUE and leaves the relation to world knowledge — "I'm a Principal Engineer now"
    (that a Principal Engineer is a *title*), "I'm vegan now" (that vegan is a *diet*), "Dan is now an
    engineering manager" — this returns None and the write is a plain append. That is not a gap waiting to
    be patched with a bigger regex: no deterministic keyer can cross it without an ontology or a model.
    Pass `key=` explicitly, or plug `make_llm_extractor`, when you need those bound.

    A subject that does not REFER — pronoun, expletive, interrogative, quantifier ("it", "there", "these",
    "what", "both approaches") — is rejected, because such keys collide across unrelated sentences and
    would make supersession retire live records."""
