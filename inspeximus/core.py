inspeximus — a memory layer for AI agents.  (brand: Inspeximus)

The memory that runs an autonomous research OS over ~5,800 notes, distilled to a single file with
no required dependencies. It does the four things agent memory actually needs, the way that held up
in production:

  remember(text)      append-only raw capture, stamped with an ABSOLUTE time (never rewritten)
  recall(query, k)    value-ranked retrieval: relevance × the memory's accrued value, not just
                      cosine similarity — the high-value memories surface first
  consolidate(cap)    the "dream" pass: value-rank under a keep-budget, link near-duplicates, mark
                      stale/superseded — it only ADDS a derived layer, it never edits the raw note
  contradictions()    flag mutually-incompatible memories for REVIEW (never auto-delete)

Design rules that are not optional (each one cost us to learn):
  • Raw capture is immutable. Consolidation adds links/markers; it never overwrites the source —
    that is what stops the slow accuracy drift of LLM-rewritten memory.
  • Absolute timestamps at write time. Relative/derived times rot the moment they're consolidated.
  • Value-ranked, capacity-aware consolidation. The payoff from ranking *what to keep* scales
    super-linearly as the budget shrinks (measured), so retention tracks value, not recency — and
    NOT access-frequency: decaying on reads keeps *popular* memories, but popularity != value, so a
    pure access-reset policy starves the rarely-read-but-load-bearing fact (measured: it retains
    ~3x less total value than a value blend under a tight budget). Forgetting blends value + recency.
  • Report value at the COHORT level (tag / time-block), never per-memory: per-item value at n-of-1
    is statistical noise; cohorts are where the signal lives.
  • Contradictions are flagged for review, not auto-resolved. Silent rewrites destroy trust.

Bring your own embedder for semantic recall (any text->vector fn); with none, inspeximus falls back to a
lexical token overlap so it runs anywhere, today.

# layout: MAGIC(5) + salt(16) + nonce(12) + ciphertext(+16B GCM tag); the MAGIC|salt|nonce header is fed as
# AEAD associated data so a tampered header fails decryption. A raw 32-byte key is used directly; a passphrase
# is stretched with scrypt (memory-hard). HONEST SCOPE (do not overclaim): this protects the store AT REST —
# someone who reads the file, a stolen disk, or a backup. It does NOT protect a COMPROMISED RUNNING PROCESS
# (the key + plaintext live in RAM), the key holder, or against malware/keyloggers; it is not end-to-end and
# not runtime memory protection. CRYPTO-SHREDDING (shred()): destroying the key makes the ciphertext — and
# every at-rest copy/backup of it — permanently unrecoverable (NIST SP 800-88 recognises key-destruction as a
# valid "Purge"). Honest caveats: it cannot reach plaintext already copied to RAM/OS-swap, or any store that

# WHY: a per-tool reversibility label is unsound for VERB-POLYMORPHIC universal executors -- a shell / eval /
# arbitrary-SQL / generic-HTTP tool whose EFFECT is set by a free-form argument, so the same tool is both
# 'ls' (reversible) and 'rm -rf' (irreversible). MEASURED (inspeximus lab, ToolEmu 330 tools, 2 labelers): tool
# reversibility is ~93% decidable from the signature (Cohen's kappa 0.82) but the ~7% undecidable residual is
# exactly this class, and its realized harm-reach is ENVIRONMENT-conditional -- an isolated executor reaches
# ~0% of external/API irreversible harms but a networked, ambiently-credentialed one reaches ~0.66. So the
# thing that bounds a memory-poisoned agent's irreversible EXTERNAL harm through such a tool is executor
# CONTAINMENT, not a per-tool reversibility flag. This detector + the spend_irreversible(tool=, contained=)
# gate make that undecidability EXPLICIT: an uncontained universal executor is never silently treated as
# reversible. Honest bound: heuristic name/param match (not a proof), and `contained` is a caller ASSERTION
# inspeximus cannot verify -- it forces the declaration, it does not enforce the sandbox.

        """Tamper-evidence for the ATTRIBUTION FLOOR. k, the influence budget, the influence gate and slash are all
        keyed on a memory's canonical source id; a post-hoc RELABEL (rewriting a record's source, or stripping its
        inherited derived_from taint) therefore voids all of them at once, silently, with no inner layer to appeal
        to — attribution is not a fourth axis, it is the floor the others stand on. This binds each write's
        attribution into the tamper-evident receipt chain (see _write_commit) and reports, per memory, whether its
        CURRENT canonical sources still match what was committed at write time. A relabel is thus LOUD, not silent.

        Returns {ok, chain_ok, relabeled, uncommitted, missing}:
          - relabeled: active memory ids whose current sources differ from their receipt (the attack this catches);
          - uncommitted: active ids with no attribution in their receipt (written before this was added, or the
            memory was never receipted) — cannot be checked, so not trusted;
          - missing: ids in the receipt chain no longer in the store.
        TWO honest limits (do NOT read this as tamper-PROOF):
        1. tamper-evidence != CORRECTNESS. A source that was WRONG at write time (an attacker who controls the
           labeling channel, e.g. MINJA) is committed faithfully and this cannot tell it was wrong — the
           genuinely-open oracle problem, untouched.
        2. the chain is only tamper-EVIDENT if it is SIGNED with a receipt_key held OFF the write path (or its head
           is externally anchored). UNSIGNED (the default), an attacker who can silently relabel rec['source'] can
           equally recompute the whole sidecar receipt chain with the new sources and pass this check — so bare
           verify_attribution() only catches a relabel by an actor who can edit the store but NOT the .receipts
           sidecar (e.g. an out-of-band DB edit). For the 'loud' property to hold against a store-capable attacker
           you MUST pass receipt_key=... (Ed25519) with the key out of reach, or anchor the chain head externally.
        Requires receipts enabled at write time. The crypto is textbook (Haber-Stornetta 1991 hash-chains,
        Schneier-Kelsey 1998 tamper-evident logs); the only new bit is committing attribution so a source-keyed
        defense set's single silent failure (relabel) becomes detectable."""

        the same topic RETIRES the old one (inspeximus's keyed supersession: recall always returns the CURRENT decision,
        the reversal is a ledgered/attributable event, and `revert('decision::<topic>')` restores the prior one).
        This is inspeximus's integrity moat applied to decisions — something an LLM-extracted fact store cannot do:
        decisions stay current, correctable, revertible, and auditable, with NO LLM and NO similarity guesswork.

        This is the DETERMINISTIC half of decision capture (the caller/agent states the decision). The OPTIONAL
        LLM half — distilling decisions out of a raw transcript automatically, the way mem0/Zep extract facts on
        write — is `distill_and_remember()` (you choose whether to pay an LLM; the store/correction/erasure stays
        deterministic). Returns the new memory id."""

        2026-07-16). Ingest an OBSERVATION (evidence, NOT an authoritative write) about `key` that CONTRADICTS the
        current high-confidence settled value. It NEVER writes an authoritative value — it can only REOPEN a
        settled record for steward review (reopened()/resolve_reopened); the record stays 'active' so recall()
        still returns it. Catches the confident wrong-merge write-time can't, and gives the value-obscuring revert
        something to key on. It does NOT decide the reopened case — legit-vs-injected still needs authority.

        TWO keying modes:
        * SUPPORT-KEYED (pass `support`, marintkael's fix 2026-07-16) — this is justification-based truth
          maintenance (Doyle 1979 JTMS: a node's belief is a function of its SUPPORT set, not the proposition, and
          a relabel fires when a NEW justification arrives; de Kleer 1986 ATMS: distinct minimal-environment
          labels = 'distinct novel supports'; Dung 1995 reinstatement: an argument reopens only when a NEW
          attacker/defender enters). Key reopen on NOVELTY-OF-SUPPORT, not on
          value. A restatement whose grounds the ledger has already seen (or that carries no support) is an ECHO
          -> silenced, even though it contradicts the current value; only a contradiction resting on grounds NOT
          in the record's justification set reopens. So replay collapses into the echo case BY CONSTRUCTION (same
          value, same stale support) and the value-disagreement DoS lever falls off, while an honest late
          correction that brings NEW ground still gets through. Corroboration counts DISTINCT novel support
          signatures (splitting one intent into two emissions shares support -> one sig -> does not corroborate),
          which is independence measured at the support level. HONEST LIMIT: novelty-of-support is itself a
          provenance judgement pushed one level down, not certified — reopened() stays a queue, not a resolution.
        * VALUE-KEYED (omit `support`, legacy 1.9.2): reopen on a value-contradiction corroborated by >=
          reopen_corroboration observations. Kept byte-identical for existing callers.

        / erasure request, a poisoned or libellous memory, or a hard correction.

        Select by `ids` (a single id or an iterable) and/or `where` (a predicate fn(record)->bool; e.g.
        lambda r: 'secret' in r['text']). VERIFIED FORGETTING: the matched records are deleted AND their ids

        vec matrix + token caches are dropped — so a forgotten memory cannot resurface via recall, via a
        consolidation link, or via a stale derived-summary pointer. This is complete because consolidation
        never copies raw text into other records (it only links ids and toggles status) — there is no merged
        blob left holding the forgotten content.

        EVERY deletion emits a hash-chained, content-free tombstone, exactly like forget_subject() and

        The ledger knows what "the old one" is — no value token needed.

        If the store was created with `revert_authority`, this requires `capability` = revert_capability(key)
        (an out-of-band token the content path cannot mint); a missing/wrong one returns
        {"ok": False, "reason": "authorization_required"} and changes nothing. This is the AUTHENTICATION half:
        an unmarked "go back" and a stale echo are byte-identical, so the tie-break cannot come from the text —
        it comes from an authority whose origin an attacker who can only write text cannot author.

        Why an explicit API and not a content write: a value-OBSCURING reversion utterance ("go back
        to the old one", "the earlier value was right") carries NO object to key on, so no content-level
        mechanism can distinguish a legitimate user revert from an attacker-injected one — the two are
        byte-identical text differing only in provenance. inspeximus resolves this by CHANNEL SEPARATION:
        content writes can never undo a supersession (echo_guard retires restatements; an object-less
        utterance never touches the key at all), and reverting is possible ONLY through this explicit
        call, which the harness invokes for an authorized principal. Honest boundary: this moves the
        legitimate-vs-injected decision from the store to the calling agent — a store cannot make it
        (identical content, different provenance), but it CAN guarantee that content alone never flips
        a corrected value, which is the property injected text needs.

        Target selection is deterministic from the supersession ledger: the record whose
        `superseded_by_toggle` points at the current active record (i.e. exactly what the current value
        replaced), never an echo-blocked arrival (those were retired stale-on-arrival, they were never
        the current value). Append-only: history is not edited — the revert writes a NEW record with
        reaffirm=True (the one sanctioned path past the echo guard), so the flip is itself a ledgered,

          1. REFERENCE RESOLUTION (a text problem): embed the candidate and, using the ledger's own split of
             the key's history into SUPERSEDED (old) and CURRENT records, measure how much closer the
             candidate sits to the old side than the current side. Needs an embedder (`self.embed` or the
             `embed` arg); with none it abstains rather than guessing. This is the structural-similarity step,
             scored as a MARGIN (max sim to old records minus max sim to current records) — the same
             discriminating quantity the decomposition used, not an absolute similarity.
          2. RECENCY ATTRIBUTION (a ledger problem): the old-versus-current split is read straight from
             inspeximus's supersession ledger. No text method is asked to decide which value is current.

        Abstains when the reference does not DISCRIMINATE old from current: |margin| < `margin` (a bare
        "go back" is roughly equally near both, so it names no side) or the best match is below `floor` (an
        off-topic utterance). That is exactly the boundary the analysis measured — where a guess is wrong and
        the authorized-revert channel (submit_revert) is the correct path instead.

        CLASSIFIES ONLY, never restores: a content-path utterance must not flip a corrected value without an
        out-of-band authorization. Returns {intent, target, confidence, current} for an authorized caller to

        """WRITE-PATH INTENT ROUTER: tag an utterance (assert / correct / revert / echo), resolve a fuzzy
        version reference against the key's timeline, and execute the right ledger operation — so a
        value-obscuring revert ("go back to what we had") works without the caller naming a value, and a
        similarity/cosine path never runs on a revert (a revert is an instruction on the version graph,
        not a value). This ships the split measured in inspeximus/probes/intent_tagger_router_probe.py.

        Resolution (deterministic, no LLM):
          - a revert-marked utterance -> revert. Target: a named historical value if present in the text;
            "original / very first / started with" -> the FIRST version; otherwise the predecessor via
            revert(). Restores go through the sanctioned reaffirm channel, so the flip is ledgered.
          - a value-bearing utterance whose value is new or current -> remember() (keyed supersession).
          - a value-bearing utterance whose value was SUPERSEDED for the key, with no revert marker ->
            the ambiguous echo-or-reaffirm case, and `policy` decides (see below).
        key/object are derived from the extractor hook when not passed; a revert with no resolvable key
        falls back to a plain note (never guesses a ledger key it can't match).

        THE HONEST LIMIT (measured, not asserted): an unmarked restatement of a superseded value is
        AMBIGUOUS BY CONSTRUCTION — a stale echo and a deliberate reaffirm can be byte-identical, so no
        classifier (LLMs measured at ~coin-flip: 0.35-0.55) can separate them from text. `policy` picks
        the failure mode you accept:
          - "safe" (default): treat as an echo — never restores. With echo_guard on it lands retired
            (judge-logged 'echo_guard'); with echo_guard off it is written WITHOUT the key so it cannot
            LWW-clobber the current value. Cost: a legitimate unmarked reaffirm is refused (measured
            1.00 echo-blocked / 0.00 reaffirm-honored).
          - "context": restore when `context` (the preceding turn) shows change-awareness (a change word
            + the current value). Separates honest twins (1.00/1.00) but is FORGEABLE — an attacker who
            writes two turns walks through it (forged-context echo restored 100%). Use only when the
            context channel is trusted.
          - "trusting": treat as a reaffirm — always restores (0.00 echo-blocked / 1.00 honored).
        The unforgeable separator is provenance — an authorized revert() call or an explicit marker —
        never smarter classification; that is the channel-separation thesis, now with the receipt.

        epoch float). This is the bi-temporal 'as-of' / time-travel read — reconstruct history, not
        just the latest value. No graph DB: keyed supersession already stamps every record with a
        validity interval [valid_from, invalidated_at) (invalidated_at=None means still current), so
        the answer is the record whose interval contains `when`.

        Why it matters: a plain memory store only tells you the value NOW; audit, debugging, and
        'what did the agent believe when it made decision X' need the value as of that moment. A
        back-filled record (added later with an earlier valid_from) is placed by its event-time, so

        unclean history) resolve to the latest valid_from <= when.

        mode: 'auto' (default) uses LEXICAL token overlap while the store is small (< semantic_threshold
        active memories) and a LEXICAL+SEMANTIC HYBRID (Reciprocal Rank Fusion) once it grows past that —
        the hybrid robustly beat either channel alone in our agent-memory benchmark (details in the recall
        body / inspeximus/probes/locomo_retrieval_map.py). Force a single channel with mode='lexical' /
        'semantic', or the fusion explicitly with mode='hybrid'. Semantic/hybrid need an embedder (set on
        the store); without one, or if embedding fails, recall falls back to lexical automatically.

        where: an OPT-IN metadata pre-filter applied to the candidate pool BEFORE ranking — the cheap
        'filter before you rank' lever (measured on LoCoMo: a metadata pre-filter can beat retriever choice;
        inspeximus/probes/locomo_metadata_prefilter.py). A dict of field -> condition; a record must match ALL
        fields (AND). Each field is matched against the record's top-level attributes first, then its meta
        dict, so both `valid_from`/`mtype`/`key` and any `meta` key work. A condition is either a scalar
        (equality), a list/tuple/set (membership), or a dict of operators:
        {"$gte","$lte","$gt","$lt","$in","$nin","$ne","$contains"} — e.g. a time range
        where={"valid_from": {"$gte": t0, "$lte": t1}} (hard-filter the SOLVED half), or a closed-set
        entity where={"speaker": {"$in": ["Caroline","Mel"]}}. NOTE: this is a HARD filter — a record that
        doesn't match is removed, so on lossy/predicted extraction prefer a broad/loose filter (or rerank)
        over an aggressive one, since a wrong filter hard-deletes the answer (measured harm mode).

        influence_only (OPT-IN, default False -> zero behavior change): restrict the result to CORROBORATED
        memories — those that meet the same bar inspeximus uses for episodic->semantic GRADUATION (an EARNED
        net-positive outcome via credit() [good>0 and good>=bad], OR already-graduated 'semantic' type, OR
        >=2 DISTINCT-canonical-source corroborating links). This is the retrieve-then-INFLUENCE split: recall
        freely for context, but call with influence_only=True for the set that is allowed to DRIVE an action.
        MEASURED (inspeximus/probes/agentpoison_influence_gate*.py) against a real AgentPoison-style single-
        instance retrieval-poisoning attack (Chen et al., NeurIPS 2024, arXiv:2407.12784; PoisonedRAG, Zou
        et al., arXiv:2402.07867): a natural-sentence trigger hijacks RAW top-1 retrieval 88-100% and is
        scale-invariant (60->10k memories), and retrieval-time / embedding-geometry defenses do NOT
        generalize across encoders — but influence_only drops the single-instance poison's rank-1 hijack to
        0% on all three tested retrievers (MiniLM/BGE/Contriever) and all scales, because an injected poison
        never earns corroboration while legitimate memories earn it through use. It GENERALIZES precisely
        because it lives in provenance metadata, not embedding geometry. HONEST COST (calibration tradeoff):
        a rare-but-true memory that has not yet earned corroboration is filtered too (measured recall 1.00
        corroborated vs 0.08 uncorroborated) — so this is for adversarial / untrusted-ingestion use, where a
        recalled-but-uncorroborated memory should inform but not unilaterally drive an action. It RAISES
        attacker cost (a single free injection is filtered; defeating it needs >=3 coordinated records with
        >=2 independent forged provenances) rather than making poisoning impossible. Reversible: default
        False = legacy recall. Call `influence_gate_report()` first to see this gate's LIVE cost on your store
        (it is density-dependent: ~51% of legit recalls filtered when memories are used ~once, ~6% when dense
        — inspeximus/probes/oracle_separation_density.py) and the load-bearing caveat that it rides on an
        un-self-gradable credit() oracle.

        prefer / prefer_trust (OPT-IN, default None -> zero behavior change): a SOFT, trust-weighted metadata
        filter. Unlike `where` (a HARD filter that DELETES non-matching records — so a wrong filter hard-
        deletes the answer), `prefer` takes the same condition dict but only BOOSTS matching records'
        score by (1 + prefer_trust * gain), leaving non-matching records rankable. prefer_trust in [0,1] is
        HOW MUCH to trust the filter cue this call: pass a low value when your metadata extractor is unsure
        (weak/ambiguous match) so the filter gracefully backs off toward plain recall; prefer_trust=0 == no
        filter. This is the a-priori-trust lever: weight the filter by the RELIABILITY of the extraction
        (e.g. alias-match strength: exact-name hit -> ~1.0, no-name/ambiguous guess -> ~0.0), NOT by the
        extractor model's own self-reported confidence (which is corrupted in the overconfident-on-wrong
        case). MEASURED (inspeximus/probes/locomo_soft_prefer_filter.py) on LoCoMo: soft prefer weighted by
        alias-strength gives the filter's benefit on reliable (exact-name) queries while backing off on
        ambiguous ones where extraction fails -- beating both no filter and a hard `where` filter under
        imperfect extraction. Reversible: prefer=None = legacy recall.

        MULTI-DIMENSION prefer (compose several soft cues at once): pass `prefer` as a LIST of specs, each
        either {"cond": <dict>, "trust": <0..1>} or a (cond, trust) tuple. Matching dimensions compose as a
        PRODUCT of neutral-at-1.0 factors — pref = Π (1 + trust_i * gain) over the dims a record matches — so
        a record matching two cues is boosted more than one matching a single cue, and non-matching dims are
        inert (factor 1.0). A single dict + scalar prefer_trust is the one-dimension case (unchanged). Cap the
        TOTAL boost with `prefer_max_boost` (a ceiling on the product, like Elasticsearch function_score's
        max_boost); default None = uncapped. MEASURED (inspeximus/probes/locomo_composed_soft_filters.py) on LoCoMo:
        on questions carrying two independent cues (a resolved time window AND a named speaker), the product
        composition reached recall@20 0.865 vs 0.755 for the best single cue (+0.110, bootstrap CI excludes 0);
        a naive summed boost CAPPED at one dimension's trust crowded out (-0.053, the cap flattened the joint
        evidence — the classic 'combine outside the saturating form' failure, BM25F, Robertson et al. CIKM
        2004). So: compose as a PRODUCT, and if you cap, cap the product, not the summed trusts. This mirrors
        production search (Elasticsearch function_score defaults score_mode=multiply). Reversible: a single
        dict / None behaves exactly as before.

        tie_recent (OPT-IN, default None -> zero behavior change): NEAR-TIE RECENCY REORDER for stale-vs-
        fresh fact competition. When a fact is later corrected in free text, SRO supersession never triggers
        and the STALE value can outrank the fresh one (measured on MemBench knowledge_update: the stale
        value wins rank-1 in 32.7% of update questions, identically for raw cosine and inspeximus semantic —
        inspeximus/probes/membench_recall_probe_v2.py). Pass a small similarity epsilon (measured sweet spot
        0.02-0.05 on centered cosine): candidates whose RELEVANCE is within tie_recent of the strongest
        candidate's relevance are re-ordered newest-first (by valid_from, falling back to ts) ahead of the
        rest; everything below the band keeps its score order. MEASURED
        (inspeximus/probes/membench_recency_tiebreak_probe.py, 222 questions incl. 3 control splits):
        tie_recent=0.05 cuts stale-beats-fresh 0.327 -> 0.109 (3x) at ~zero hit@1/5 cost on non-update
        control splits; a LINEAR position bonus was measured USELESS (no SBF movement before it damages
        controls) — the band reorder is the shape that works. HONEST SCOPE: (a) in the benchmark the
        correction always comes after the original mention (by construction); the control-split cost is
        the fairness check; (b) adversarial hole: an ECHO of the stale value re-stated AFTER the correction
        would be promoted — tie_recent trusts recency inside the band, so do not use it on hostile
        ingestion without provenance gating (combine with influence_only). Reversible: None = legacy."""

        bad-rate breaches a budget; you (or a human) then decide whether to slash(). This is the cumulative
        trigger the retroactive slash needs: slash can't fire per-slice (per-slice P(detected)~=0, and the
        deterrence bond scales with 1/P(detected), so the penalty blows up on the slow salami attack), so the
        signal has to be cumulative. On each attributed outcome, a one-sided CUSUM: S = max(0, S + weight*(bad -
        k)); alarm at S >= h. Attribution rides the derived_from taint (a bad outcome on a summary charges ALL
        its inherited sources), so slices later summarized still accumulate against their origin — the per-source
        budget and the slash are the same plumbing on the provenance substrate.
        Drop-in for credit() (also records the per-memory good/bad standing): monitor(recalled_ids, outcome).

        THREE honest limits (from a full adversarial review — do not overclaim this 'solves' poisoning):
        1. NOT exact-optimal: (x - k) is the Gaussian-mean-shift CUSUM; the exactly-optimal statistic for a
           Bernoulli bad-indicator increments by the log-likelihood ratio. This is a CUSUM-TYPE detector.
        2. k IS A TOLERATED-RATE PRICE, NOT A WALL: an attacker who holds its per-source bad-rate at/below k
           produces non-positive drift -> S -> 0 -> PROVABLY undetectable (the ARL<->detectability duality). So
           this catches the careless/impatient poisoner; a patient one nets a bounded k x exposure residual —
           the detection-latency floor moved to k, not closed. Lowering k to chase it just raises false alarms
           on honest sources.
        3. DO NOT AUTO-FIRE THE IRREVERSIBLE PENALTY. auto_slash DEFAULTS OFF for a reason: 70 years of
           auto-penalty systems (SPC -> fraud -> content moderation) converged on automatic DETECTION + a
           human-reviewable, REVERSIBLE penalty, never auto-fired forfeiture — because a drifting base-rate
           guarantees false alarms, and with taint a single false positive nukes a whole downstream tree
           (guilt-by-linkage), and if outcomes are attacker-influenceable (MINJA) the trigger becomes a framing
           weapon (feed bad outcomes attributed to a rival -> auto-slash the rival; cf. RepTrap / bad-mouthing).
           Recommended: on alarm, cap/freeze the source's forward influence (reversible) and queue a HUMAN
           review; confirm the slash by hand; keep restore() one call away.

        Tuning: `k` in (0,1) is the bad-rate you contractually tolerate (drift reference); `h` sets the
        false-alarm rate (ARL ~ exp(h)) and the detection delay ~ h/(true_rate - k) — the Lorden floor.
        `auto_slash=True` is an explicit opt-in for a high-integrity, un-self-gradable oracle only. State
        persists to a side file (cross-session). Returns {alarms, slashed, cusum}. Undo a false alarm with

        the rate-detector (monitor) provably CANNOT: the strictly-below-k patient attacker. monitor()'s k is a
        tolerated RATE, so an attacker holding bad-rate BELOW k gives the CUSUM negative drift -> no detection
        power above the baseline false-alarm rate, netting k x exposure — and exposure is PER-WINDOW, so over an
        unbounded horizon its TOTAL irreversible blast grows without bound. Capping a rate never bounds the
        integral. This caps the integral directly: each irreversible (hard-to-undo) action an application is about
        to take is metered against the LIFETIME budget of every source that influenced it (own source OR inherited
        derived_from taint). Once a source has spent its budget, further irreversible actions carrying its influence
        are DENIED — so THAT source's total irreversible damage is bounded by the budget, a finite number YOU
        choose, not a rate you tolerate forever. This bounds a KNOWN source only: a Sybil/whitewashing attacker
        gets a fresh budget per identity, so the identity count (bounded by a DIFFERENT axis — a capability ceiling
        or identity cost; Douceur, Friedman-Resnick) is what caps the total, not this — the budget relocates the
        residual to the identity axis, it does not close it.

        Call it as the gate on the IRREVERSIBLE TAIL ONLY: spend_irreversible(recalled_ids, amount=blast) returns
        {'allowed': bool}; iff allowed, the caller performs the irreversible action and the spend is booked
        (monotonic). REVERSIBLE influence is never metered — genuinely-good sources keep UNBOUNDED reversible
        influence and only their irreversible tail is finite (the everyone-pays shape of a hard capability ceiling,
        but charged only where the action is actually irreversible). The tightest contributing source binds: an
        action tainted by an exhausted source is blocked, exactly as slash() burns every derived summary a caught
        source fed.

        Orthogonal to standing: NOT refunded by restore() (an irreversible action cannot be un-done, so its
        integral is permanent) and does NOT read good/bad. It composes with the other axes as price(k, monitor) +
        BOUND(this lifetime budget) + a reversible human gate(slash/restore) on the irreversible tail — but this is
        NOT a closed decomposition: all three lean on a fourth, unbounded axis, SOUND ATTRIBUTION — the budget, the
        rate detector, and the gate all assume the app can correctly assign an action to its source and correctly
        label its irreversibility + blast `amount`; a misattributed or mislabeled action (or an attacker-influenced
        classifier) escapes all of them. Two more honest limits: refund-free forfeiture is itself a griefing vector
        (get bad irreversible actions attributed/taint-linked to a rival's source and you permanently exhaust its
        budget — RepTrap on the budget axis), and `amount` is caller-supplied so one action of size=budget exhausts
        a source in a single shot (k never enters the guarantee; the bound is the budget, per source). Prior art
        (textbook; the shipped plumbing is what's new): a total-budget-on-cumulative-cost is the differential-
        privacy privacy budget (a total epsilon caps cumulative leakage across queries under composition; Dwork &
        Roth 2014), an SRE error budget, a VaR / loss limit, and Sagas' compensable-vs-non-compensable split
        (Garcia-Molina & Salem 1987) — 'cap the integral, not the rate'. Persists to a side file (cross-session).
        Returns {allowed, exhausted, sources, spent}. Deliberately no cheap programmatic refund — raise a reviewed
        source's ceiling by calling with a higher budget or editing the side file by hand."""

           covers a large fraction of the corpus's common vocabulary scores ~1.0 against ALMOST ANY
           query and drowns the specific memory the user actually wanted (measured on a 6k-note
           vault: such hubs sat in the top-10 for ~47% of queries). We mark them `status:'hub'`
           (reversible; recall skips them unless include_hubs) — measured to lift recall@5 ~+22%.
        2. near-duplicate LINKING (dedup without delete) — EXCEPT a polarity clash, which is a
           STATE TOGGLE (preference flip): supersede the OLDER, since a contradiction is not a dup.
        3. keep-budget: mark the lowest-value surplus `superseded`.

        hub_coverage: a memory covering ≥ this fraction of the common vocabulary is a hub (0 disables).
        link_duplicates: the dup pass is O(n²); pass False to skip it on large stores.

        TENANT ISOLATION: on a tenant-bound store/view the dream pass operates ONLY on that tenant's rows, so

        Two deterministic signals, both cheap (O(neighbourhood), not the O(n^2) `contradictions()` scan):
          - keyed_value_change: an active memory shares `key` but carries a DIFFERENT `object` (or, if no
            object is given, its text clashes) — a value update on a managed key, the thing to gate on for
            a high-stakes fact.
          - clash: among memories SIMILAR to `text` (>= sim_threshold), a value clash (numeric update) or a
            negation/polarity flip. Crucially this is NOT triggered by a pure duplicate — a restated
            identical fact has no value/negation clash — so it separates a contradiction from a near-dup,
            which a cosine-similarity gate cannot (a corrected value is often MORE embedding-similar to the
            original than a rephrase). Pass `incompatible(a, b) -> bool` (e.g. an LLM judge) to also catch a

#   - make_llm_extractor(call_fn) : OPT-IN factory. Wraps YOUR llm(prompt)->str call to extract (key, object).
#     This PUTS AN LLM ON THE WRITE PATH — you trade determinism/zero-cost for auto-capture of unstructured text.
# Both are fail-open (Inspeximus.remember swallows extractor exceptions and appends the raw text).
