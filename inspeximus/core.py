inspeximus — a memory layer for AI agents.  (brand: Inspeximus)

The memory that runs an autonomous research OS over ~5,800 notes, distilled to a single file with
no required dependencies. It does the four things agent memory actually needs, the way that held up
in production:

  remember(text)      append-only raw capture, stamped with an ABSOLUTE time (never rewritten)
  recall(query, k)    value-ranked retrieval: relevance × the memory's accrued value, not just
                      cosine similarity — the high-value memories surface first
  consolidate(cap)    the "dream" pass: value-rank under a keep-budget, link near-duplicates, mark
                      stale/superseded — it only ADDS a derived layer, it never edits the raw note
  contradictions()    flag mutually-incompatible memories for REVIEW (never auto-delete)

Design rules that are not optional (each one cost us to learn):
  • Raw capture is immutable. Consolidation adds links/markers; it never overwrites the source —
    that is what stops the slow accuracy drift of LLM-rewritten memory.
  • Absolute timestamps at write time. Relative/derived times rot the moment they're consolidated.
  • Value-ranked, capacity-aware consolidation. The payoff from ranking *what to keep* scales
    super-linearly as the budget shrinks (measured), so retention tracks value, not recency — and
    NOT access-frequency: decaying on reads keeps *popular* memories, but popularity != value, so a
    pure access-reset policy starves the rarely-read-but-load-bearing fact (measured: it retains
    ~3x less total value than a value blend under a tight budget). Forgetting blends value + recency.
  • Report value at the COHORT level (tag / time-block), never per-memory: per-item value at n-of-1
    is statistical noise; cohorts are where the signal lives.
  • Contradictions are flagged for review, not auto-resolved. Silent rewrites destroy trust.

Bring your own embedder for semantic recall (any text->vector fn); with none, inspeximus falls back to a
lexical token overlap so it runs anywhere, today.

        attribution into the tamper-evident receipt chain (see _write_commit) and reports, per memory, whether its
        CURRENT canonical sources still match what was committed at write time. A relabel is thus LOUD, not silent.

        Returns {ok, chain_ok, relabeled, uncommitted, missing}:
          - relabeled: active memory ids whose current sources differ from their receipt (the attack this catches);
          - uncommitted: active ids with no attribution in their receipt (written before this was added, or the
            memory was never receipted) — cannot be checked, so not trusted;

        TWO honest limits (do NOT read this as tamper-PROOF):
        1. tamper-evidence != CORRECTNESS. A source that was WRONG at write time (an attacker who controls the
           labeling channel, e.g. MINJA) is committed faithfully and this cannot tell it was wrong — the
           genuinely-open oracle problem, untouched.
        2. the chain is only tamper-EVIDENT if it is SIGNED with a receipt_key held OFF the write path (or its head
           is externally anchored). UNSIGNED (the default), an attacker who can silently relabel rec['source'] can
           equally recompute the whole sidecar receipt chain with the new sources and pass this check — so bare
           verify_attribution() only catches a relabel by an actor who can edit the store but NOT the .receipts
           sidecar (e.g. an out-of-band DB edit). For the 'loud' property to hold against a store-capable attacker
           you MUST pass receipt_key=... (Ed25519) with the key out of reach, or anchor the chain head externally.
        Requires receipts enabled at write time. The crypto is textbook (Haber-Stornetta 1991 hash-chains,
        Schneier-Kelsey 1998 tamper-evident logs); the only new bit is committing attribution so a source-keyed
        defense set's single silent failure (relabel) becomes detectable."""

        Memories the dream pass flagged as hubs (universal matchers) are skipped unless include_hubs.

        mode: 'auto' (default) uses LEXICAL token overlap while the store is small (< semantic_threshold
        active memories) and a LEXICAL+SEMANTIC HYBRID (Reciprocal Rank Fusion) once it grows past that —
        the hybrid robustly beat either channel alone in our agent-memory benchmark (details in the recall
        body / inspeximus/probes/locomo_retrieval_map.py). Force a single channel with mode='lexical' /
        'semantic', or the fusion explicitly with mode='hybrid'. Semantic/hybrid need an embedder (set on
        the store); without one, or if embedding fails, recall falls back to lexical automatically.

        where: an OPT-IN metadata pre-filter applied to the candidate pool BEFORE ranking — the cheap
        'filter before you rank' lever (measured on LoCoMo: a metadata pre-filter can beat retriever choice;
        inspeximus/probes/locomo_metadata_prefilter.py). A dict of field -> condition; a record must match ALL
        fields (AND). Each field is matched against the record's top-level attributes first, then its meta
        dict, so both `valid_from`/`mtype`/`key` and any `meta` key work. A condition is either a scalar
        (equality), a list/tuple/set (membership), or a dict of operators:
        {"$gte","$lte","$gt","$lt","$in","$nin","$ne","$contains"} — e.g. a time range
        where={"valid_from": {"$gte": t0, "$lte": t1}} (hard-filter the SOLVED half), or a closed-set
        entity where={"speaker": {"$in": ["Caroline","Mel"]}}. NOTE: this is a HARD filter — a record that
        doesn't match is removed, so on lossy/predicted extraction prefer a broad/loose filter (or rerank)
        over an aggressive one, since a wrong filter hard-deletes the answer (measured harm mode).

        influence_only (OPT-IN, default False -> zero behavior change): restrict the result to CORROBORATED
        memories — those that meet the same bar inspeximus uses for episodic->semantic GRADUATION (an EARNED
        net-positive outcome via credit() [good>0 and good>=bad], OR already-graduated 'semantic' type, OR
        >=2 DISTINCT-canonical-source corroborating links). This is the retrieve-then-INFLUENCE split: recall
        freely for context, but call with influence_only=True for the set that is allowed to DRIVE an action.
        MEASURED (inspeximus/probes/agentpoison_influence_gate*.py) against a real AgentPoison-style single-
        instance retrieval-poisoning attack (Chen et al., NeurIPS 2024, arXiv:2407.12784; PoisonedRAG, Zou
        et al., arXiv:2402.07867): a natural-sentence trigger hijacks RAW top-1 retrieval 88-100% and is
        scale-invariant (60->10k memories), and retrieval-time / embedding-geometry defenses do NOT
        generalize across encoders — but influence_only drops the single-instance poison's rank-1 hijack to
        0% on all three tested retrievers (MiniLM/BGE/Contriever) and all scales, because an injected poison
        never earns corroboration while legitimate memories earn it through use. It GENERALIZES precisely
        because it lives in provenance metadata, not embedding geometry. HONEST COST (calibration tradeoff):
        a rare-but-true memory that has not yet earned corroboration is filtered too (measured recall 1.00
        corroborated vs 0.08 uncorroborated) — so this is for adversarial / untrusted-ingestion use, where a
        recalled-but-uncorroborated memory should inform but not unilaterally drive an action. It RAISES
        attacker cost (a single free injection is filtered; defeating it needs >=3 coordinated records with
        >=2 independent forged provenances) rather than making poisoning impossible. Reversible: default
        False = legacy recall. Call `influence_gate_report()` first to see this gate's LIVE cost on your store
        (it is density-dependent: ~51% of legit recalls filtered when memories are used ~once, ~6% when dense
        — inspeximus/probes/oracle_separation_density.py) and the load-bearing caveat that it rides on an
        un-self-gradable credit() oracle.

        prefer / prefer_trust (OPT-IN, default None -> zero behavior change): a SOFT, trust-weighted metadata
        filter. Unlike `where` (a HARD filter that DELETES non-matching records — so a wrong filter hard-
        deletes the answer), `prefer` takes the same condition dict but only BOOSTS matching records'
        score by (1 + prefer_trust * gain), leaving non-matching records rankable. prefer_trust in [0,1] is
        HOW MUCH to trust the filter cue this call: pass a low value when your metadata extractor is unsure
        (weak/ambiguous match) so the filter gracefully backs off toward plain recall; prefer_trust=0 == no
        filter. This is the a-priori-trust lever: weight the filter by the RELIABILITY of the extraction
        (e.g. alias-match strength: exact-name hit -> ~1.0, no-name/ambiguous guess -> ~0.0), NOT by the
        extractor model's own self-reported confidence (which is corrupted in the overconfident-on-wrong
        case). MEASURED (inspeximus/probes/locomo_soft_prefer_filter.py) on LoCoMo: soft prefer weighted by
        alias-strength gives the filter's benefit on reliable (exact-name) queries while backing off on
        ambiguous ones where extraction fails -- beating both no filter and a hard `where` filter under
        imperfect extraction. Reversible: prefer=None = legacy recall.

        MULTI-DIMENSION prefer (compose several soft cues at once): pass `prefer` as a LIST of specs, each
        either {"cond": <dict>, "trust": <0..1>} or a (cond, trust) tuple. Matching dimensions compose as a
        PRODUCT of neutral-at-1.0 factors — pref = Π (1 + trust_i * gain) over the dims a record matches — so
        a record matching two cues is boosted more than one matching a single cue, and non-matching dims are
        inert (factor 1.0). A single dict + scalar prefer_trust is the one-dimension case (unchanged). Cap the
        TOTAL boost with `prefer_max_boost` (a ceiling on the product, like Elasticsearch function_score's
        max_boost); default None = uncapped. MEASURED (inspeximus/probes/locomo_composed_soft_filters.py) on LoCoMo:
        on questions carrying two independent cues (a resolved time window AND a named speaker), the product
        composition reached recall@20 0.865 vs 0.755 for the best single cue (+0.110, bootstrap CI excludes 0);
        a naive summed boost CAPPED at one dimension's trust crowded out (-0.053, the cap flattened the joint
        evidence — the classic 'combine outside the saturating form' failure, BM25F, Robertson et al. CIKM
        2004). So: compose as a PRODUCT, and if you cap, cap the product, not the summed trusts. This mirrors
        production search (Elasticsearch function_score defaults score_mode=multiply). Reversible: a single
        dict / None behaves exactly as before.

        tie_recent (OPT-IN, default None -> zero behavior change): NEAR-TIE RECENCY REORDER for stale-vs-
        fresh fact competition. When a fact is later corrected in free text, SRO supersession never triggers
        and the STALE value can outrank the fresh one (measured on MemBench knowledge_update: the stale
        value wins rank-1 in 32.7% of update questions, identically for raw cosine and inspeximus semantic —
        inspeximus/probes/membench_recall_probe_v2.py). Pass a small similarity epsilon (measured sweet spot
        0.02-0.05 on centered cosine): candidates whose RELEVANCE is within tie_recent of the strongest
        candidate's relevance are re-ordered newest-first (by valid_from, falling back to ts) ahead of the
        rest; everything below the band keeps its score order. MEASURED
        (inspeximus/probes/membench_recency_tiebreak_probe.py, 222 questions incl. 3 control splits):
        tie_recent=0.05 cuts stale-beats-fresh 0.327 -> 0.109 (3x) at ~zero hit@1/5 cost on non-update
        control splits; a LINEAR position bonus was measured USELESS (no SBF movement before it damages
        controls) — the band reorder is the shape that works. HONEST SCOPE: (a) in the benchmark the
        correction always comes after the original mention (by construction); the control-split cost is
        the fairness check; (b) adversarial hole: an ECHO of the stale value re-stated AFTER the correction
        would be promoted — tie_recent trusts recency inside the band, so do not use it on hostile
        ingestion without provenance gating (combine with influence_only). Reversible: None = legacy."""

        deterrence bond scales with 1/P(detected), so the penalty blows up on the slow salami attack), so the
        signal has to be cumulative. On each attributed outcome, a one-sided CUSUM: S = max(0, S + weight*(bad -
        k)); alarm at S >= h. Attribution rides the derived_from taint (a bad outcome on a summary charges ALL
        its inherited sources), so slices later summarized still accumulate against their origin — the per-source
        budget and the slash are the same plumbing on the provenance substrate.
        Drop-in for credit() (also records the per-memory good/bad standing): monitor(recalled_ids, outcome).

        THREE honest limits (from a full adversarial review — do not overclaim this 'solves' poisoning):
        1. NOT exact-optimal: (x - k) is the Gaussian-mean-shift CUSUM; the exactly-optimal statistic for a
           Bernoulli bad-indicator increments by the log-likelihood ratio. This is a CUSUM-TYPE detector.
        2. k IS A TOLERATED-RATE PRICE, NOT A WALL: an attacker who holds its per-source bad-rate at/below k
           produces non-positive drift -> S -> 0 -> PROVABLY undetectable (the ARL<->detectability duality). So
           this catches the careless/impatient poisoner; a patient one nets a bounded k x exposure residual —
           the detection-latency floor moved to k, not closed. Lowering k to chase it just raises false alarms
           on honest sources.
        3. DO NOT AUTO-FIRE THE IRREVERSIBLE PENALTY. auto_slash DEFAULTS OFF for a reason: 70 years of
           auto-penalty systems (SPC -> fraud -> content moderation) converged on automatic DETECTION + a
           human-reviewable, REVERSIBLE penalty, never auto-fired forfeiture — because a drifting base-rate
           guarantees false alarms, and with taint a single false positive nukes a whole downstream tree
           (guilt-by-linkage), and if outcomes are attacker-influenceable (MINJA) the trigger becomes a framing
           weapon (feed bad outcomes attributed to a rival -> auto-slash the rival; cf. RepTrap / bad-mouthing).
           Recommended: on alarm, cap/freeze the source's forward influence (reversible) and queue a HUMAN
           review; confirm the slash by hand; keep restore() one call away.

        Tuning: `k` in (0,1) is the bad-rate you contractually tolerate (drift reference); `h` sets the
        false-alarm rate (ARL ~ exp(h)) and the detection delay ~ h/(true_rate - k) — the Lorden floor.
        `auto_slash=True` is an explicit opt-in for a high-integrity, un-self-gradable oracle only. State
        persists to a side file (cross-session). Returns {alarms, slashed, cusum}. Undo a false alarm with

        residual to the identity axis, it does not close it.

        Call it as the gate on the IRREVERSIBLE TAIL ONLY: spend_irreversible(recalled_ids, amount=blast) returns
        {'allowed': bool}; iff allowed, the caller performs the irreversible action and the spend is booked
        (monotonic). REVERSIBLE influence is never metered — genuinely-good sources keep UNBOUNDED reversible
        influence and only their irreversible tail is finite (the everyone-pays shape of a hard capability ceiling,
        but charged only where the action is actually irreversible). The tightest contributing source binds: an
        action tainted by an exhausted source is blocked, exactly as slash() burns every derived summary a caught
        source fed.

        Orthogonal to standing: NOT refunded by restore() (an irreversible action cannot be un-done, so its
        integral is permanent) and does NOT read good/bad. It composes with the other axes as price(k, monitor) +
        BOUND(this lifetime budget) + a reversible human gate(slash/restore) on the irreversible tail — but this is
        NOT a closed decomposition: all three lean on a fourth, unbounded axis, SOUND ATTRIBUTION — the budget, the
        rate detector, and the gate all assume the app can correctly assign an action to its source and correctly
        label its irreversibility + blast `amount`; a misattributed or mislabeled action (or an attacker-influenced
        classifier) escapes all of them. Two more honest limits: refund-free forfeiture is itself a griefing vector
        (get bad irreversible actions attributed/taint-linked to a rival's source and you permanently exhaust its
        budget — RepTrap on the budget axis), and `amount` is caller-supplied so one action of size=budget exhausts
        a source in a single shot (k never enters the guarantee; the bound is the budget, per source). Prior art
        (textbook; the shipped plumbing is what's new): a total-budget-on-cumulative-cost is the differential-
        privacy privacy budget (a total epsilon caps cumulative leakage across queries under composition; Dwork &
        Roth 2014), an SRE error budget, a VaR / loss limit, and Sagas' compensable-vs-non-compensable split
        (Garcia-Molina & Salem 1987) — 'cap the integral, not the rate'. Persists to a side file (cross-session).
        Returns {allowed, exhausted, sources, spent}. Deliberately no cheap programmatic refund — raise a reviewed
        source's ceiling by calling with a higher budget or editing the side file by hand."""
