"""RAMR OUTCOME-RANKED-RECALL task family (the outcome-credit channel). Every shipped memory layer ranks recall by
relevance x recency/value; NONE rank by whether a recalled memory actually LED TO A CORRECT OUTCOME. inspeximus ships
that channel (recall score x cal; cal=0.5+Beta(good,bad) reliability; fed by credit(ids, outcome)). The lab
already validated the core lift (0.37->0.66) and its robustness to a noisy credit signal. This turns it into a
benchmark family and adds the decisive new dimension: HOW DOES THE LIFT SCALE WITH RETRIEVAL AMBIGUITY?

Setup: M recurring topics; each topic has a FIXED pool of (1+MAXD) memories phrased near-identically (so embedding
similarity ~equal -> relevance ranking is ~chance among them). For each ambiguity level D we use the first 1+D of
them and randomly designate ONE as CORRECT (per set). Over T sessions, for each topic: recall top-1, score hit
(top-1 == correct), then credit([top-1], outcome=hit). Three arms over identical stores:
  NONE    : never credit -> reliability neutral -> rank by relevance only (the field's status quo)
  OUTCOME : credit with the TRUE outcome -> was-it-right reranking (inspeximus)
  RANDOM  : credit with a RANDOM outcome (control) -> if this lifts too, the gain is reranking noise, not signal
Sweep D in {1,2,4,8} (ambiguity rises; relevance chance = 1/(1+D)). Metric: OUTCOME-RANKED LIFT = final-session
accuracy(OUTCOME) - accuracy(NONE), per D, bootstrap CI over N_SETS. FALSIFIER (pre-registered): if the OUTCOME
lift CI overlaps 0, the was-it-right channel is decorative; if RANDOM lifts comparably, it's not the outcome
signal. Prediction: lift GROWS with D and RANDOM stays ~0.

EMBED-ONCE design: memory texts are a FIXED pool -> every text is embedded ONCE (cached); only the correctness
label and ambiguity window vary across conditions. This keeps embeddings identical across all conditions (cleaner)
and avoids re-embedding under GPU contention. Cloud-free (local nomic-embed-text). ASCII prints."""
